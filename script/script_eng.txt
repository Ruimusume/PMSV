About a year and a half ago...
What’s up, Giacomo? Did something happen?[VAR 0114(0020)]
The big boss just wanted my take on some stuff...\nSo we had a chat and settled on a few plans.[VAR 0114(0021)]
“A few plans”...? Like, for what?[VAR 0114(001F)]
Operation Star, first of all. And also...a new code\nof conduct for the team.[VAR 0114(0021)]
You know how tons of new members have joined\nup recently?\c\nWell, we figure we gotta make some team rules—\nlike a code—so we’ll all be on the same page.[VAR 0114(0021)]
Nice! You’ll come up with a great code for us,\nwon’t you, Giacomo?[VAR 0114(0022)]
Hah, no thanks. Waaay too much pressure.[VAR 0114(0021)]
I mean, yeah, I used to be president of the\nstudent council. But you know everyone ended\r\nup hating me after that, right?[VAR 0114(0021)]
’Course we know. You forced a ton of stuffy\nrules on everyone, and they wouldn’t take it.\c\nWe got some other nerd to replace you after,\nlike, five minutes.[VAR 0114(001F)]
I cannot help but concur...\c\n“Male students’ hair must stray no further than\n1.8 inches below the nape” and so forth...\c\nYour rules were vexation made manifest![VAR 0114(0023)]
My point exactly! So you’ll all agree that I\nshouldn’t be let anywhere near this new code.[VAR 0114(0021)]
But you always know what’s best for the team,\nGiacomo! You look out for us![VAR 0114(0020)]
You’ve earned our trust many times over. Without\nyou, Team Star just wouldn’t work.[VAR 0114(0022)]
That stuck-up student council prez isn’t who you\nare anymore, man.\c\nA code written by the Giacomo I’m lookin’ at\nnow... I’d follow that any day.[VAR 0114(001F)]
As would I![VAR 0114(0023)]
OK, OK, thanks for the ego boost, everyone.\nI’ll do it... I’ll write up the darn code.[VAR 0114(0021)]
I did the best I could...[VAR 0114(0021)]
I wrote that code myself, and there’s no goin’\nback on it now. My days as a boss are over.\r\nSo here—take my Star Badge, would ya?[VAR 0114(0021)]
I’ll give you this choice TM, too. You earned it\nfair ’n’ square.[VAR 0114(0021)]
Haaah. So this is how the party ends...[VAR 0114(0021)]
But let’s talk about th[VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]atose Pokémon of yours.\n[VAR 1101(00FD,0704)]It’sThey’re crazy strong, huh.[VAR 0114(0021)]

Nope
Huh. OK... You like it at the academy?\nHavin’ fun?[VAR 0114(0021)]
Yeah, I’m enjoying it!
It’s not the best...
No kiddin’...[VAR 0114(0021)]
Sorry to interrupt, but are you Giacomo?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Whoa-ho! Wasn’t expecting a giant pompadour\nto make a guest appearance today.\c\nYou get a Quaxwell to style that up for ya?[VAR 0114(0021)]
I’m just after a quick word. Would you mind?[VAR 0114(001E)]

So why won’t you break up the team and start\nattending class at the academy again?[VAR 0114(001E)]
That’s what you wanna know?\c\nAs it happens, we’re actually waitin’ on a pal...\nthough we don’t know if they’ll be comin’ back.[VAR 0114(0021)]
A pal...? A close friend of yours, are they?[VAR 0114(001E)]

They’re only the strongest boss in all of\nTeam Star!\c\nLike how there’s a Top Champion who’s the\nabsolute number-one Trainer, y’know?[VAR 0114(0021)]
They’re the one who invited us other bosses to\nform the team. We call ’em the “big boss.”[VAR 0114(0021)]
And where is this big boss of yours now?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Wouldn’t we like to know. We haven’t heard from\n’em in, I dunno...must be a year and a half now.[VAR 0114(0021)]
[~ 55]
We thought that if we kept Team Star going, then\nthey’d get back in touch one day.[VAR 0114(0021)]
But the teachers keep pressin’ us to call it quits,\nand then we get party crashers like you two...[VAR 0114(0021)]

Maybe the big boss did ditch us... They were\ntalkin’ about breakin’ up the team before and all.[VAR 0114(0021)]
So, Team Star and this big boss of yours...\nThey’re really that important to you?[VAR 0114(001E)]

You’re right—I’m not a member of Team Star...\nbut Don Atticus is my compadre!
I have to see him no matter what!
Well, clearly you have your reasons for\nbeing here.[VAR 0114(001E)]

Arrrghhh! What the HECK!!![VAR 0114(0020)]
Your toy car didn’t budge an inch, huh.[VAR 0114(001F)]
I told you—it’s not a toy! It’s called the\nStarmobile, and I was up all night building it![VAR 0114(0020)]
The problem’s clearly that we’re not givin’ it\nenough juice.[VAR 0114(0021)]
You designed this thing to be powered by two\nCharcadet, but it’s just too heavy.[VAR 0114(0021)]
That’s such a shame... I wanted to see the looks\non our bullies’ faces once we got it moving.[VAR 0114(0022)]
I’m sorry... I really thought it would work...[VAR 0114(0020)]
Come, good fellow. ’Tis no occasion for\nmelancholy.[VAR 0114(0023)]
Why, to make such a remarkable contraption by\nthine own hand... Genius, thy name is Ortega![VAR 0114(0023)]
Yeah, well...there’s no point if it doesn’t work,\nis there?[VAR 0114(0020)]
If I knew all that effort would have zero payout,\nI’d have just asked Mother to buy a car for us...[VAR 0114(0020)]

Wha—?[VAR 0114(0020)]
Mela! Cool it, would ya?[VAR 0114(0021)]
Yeah, how ’bout no.[VAR 0114(001F)]
I mean, we even put this in the code, for cryin’\nout loud!\c\nWhen we started Team Star, we swore to quit\nrelyin’ on our parents or bags of cash to fix our\r\nproblems for us. Or did you forget?[VAR 0114(001F)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0020)]
If that hunka junk doesn’t move, get it moving.\c\nIf we’re short on juice, just gotta crank up the\npower somehow. Doesn’t take a genius, man.[VAR 0114(001F)]
That’s easy enough to say, Mellie. Do you have\nan actual plan?[VAR 0114(0022)]
Yup. I’m gonna train up my Charcadet and have\n’em evolve. Their boosted firepower will get the\r\nStarmobile moving, no sweat.[VAR 0114(001F)]
But the hour of Operation Star is nigh at hand...\nWill you succeed in time?[VAR 0114(0023)]
Oh, I’ll get it done![VAR 0114(001F)]

[~ 40]
[~ 41]
[~ 42]
[~ 43]
He’s a...distant acquaintance of mine.[VAR 0114(003C)]
[~ 45]
[~ 46]
The name’s Clive.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Okaaay... What’s your business here?[VAR 0114(0020)]
I want you to tell me something.\c\nYou’re the son of a wealthy family and heir to a\nmajor apparel company. So why join a group like\r\nTeam Star?[VAR 0114(001E)]
What a question to ask someone you’ve just met.\c\nWell, my answer’s the same as everyone else in\nthe team... It’s ’cause I was being bullied.[VAR 0114(0020)]
So the academy really did use to have an issue\nwith bullying...[VAR 0114(001E)]
Who would guess, right? The school is all\nrainbows and butterflies these days.[VAR 0114(0020)]
And the bullies from back then don’t even go to\nthe academy anymore.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Why? What happened to them?[VAR 0114(001E)]
As the former director of the academy, I believe\nI am best positioned to answer that question.[VAR 0114(003C)]
Mr. Harrington...[VAR 0114(0020)]
About 18 months ago, the members of Team Star\nconfronted the students who used to bully them,\r\nand an altercation broke out between the groups.[VAR 0114(003C)]
Though it did not escalate into a major incident,\nthe altercation nonetheless caused a scandal of\r\nhitherto unknown proportions.[VAR 0114(003C)]
As a result of what occurred that day, the\nstudents who had perpetrated the bullying\r\ndropped out of the academy, one after another.[VAR 0114(003C)]
But...but there aren’t any records of that\nanywhere in the academy![VAR 0114(001E)]
No, I should imagine not. My former deputy\ndeleted all records of the incident, you see.[VAR 0114(003C)]
What?! Why would anyone do that?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Just as I was puzzling over how best to deal with\nTeam Star in the aftermath of the incident, a\r\ncertain student came to see me.[VAR 0114(003C)]
This student declared that they would take all\nresponsibility for the team’s actions.[VAR 0114(003C)]
In exchange, they requested that I exonerate the\nother students of Team Star from any blame.[VAR 0114(003C)]
HUH?! No...no one told me that![VAR 0114(0020)]
I accepted the request and agreed not to take\ndisciplinary action against Team Star.[VAR 0114(003C)]
Then, I assigned 18 months of overseas study to\nthe student who took responsibility for the team.[VAR 0114(003C)]
A year and a half of studying abroad...?[VAR 0114(001E)]
This was not intended as a punishment, you\nunderstand. Team Star were the victims, after all.[VAR 0114(003C)]
I wanted this student to take some time to rest,\nso I had them return home to the Galar region\r\nunder the pretext of “overseas study.”[VAR 0114(003C)]
Around that time, however, the former deputy\ndirector took it upon himself to erase all traces\r\nof the incident from the academy’s servers.\c\nIt appears his intent was to shield himself from\nany blame.[VAR 0114(003C)]
So he tried to cover up the whole thing?\nThat’s terrible![VAR 0114(001E)]
After we discovered what he had done, I dealt\nwith him appropriately, of course.[VAR 0114(003C)]
But the inability of myself and the rest of the\nteaching staff to prevent this terrible act also\r\nrepresented a grave blunder on our part.[VAR 0114(003C)]
I accepted the blame that lay at my feet and\nresigned from my position as director.\c\nThe rest of the teaching staff then joined me in\nhanding in their notices.[VAR 0114(003C)]
So that’s why the current teachers were all\nbrought in a year and a half ago...[VAR 0114(001E)]
I understand my actions have caused you a great\ndeal of trouble. You have my sincere apologies.[VAR 0114(003C)]
Hang on, Mr. Harrington! How come you\nsuddenly decided to talk about this now?![VAR 0114(0020)]
Young Master Ortega... Team Star cannot carry\non in its current fashion. I merely wish to give you\r\na chance to chart a better course.[VAR 0114(003C)]
Well, there’s no way I’m abandoning my friends\nand going to school without them. Not after\r\nwe’ve come this far![VAR 0114(0020)]
Your friends in Team Star must mean a great deal\nto you.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Isn’t that obvious?[VAR 0114(0020)]
It’s ’cause, you know...they’re my greatest\ntreasure in the whole world.[VAR 0114(0020)]

Um, just one thing...\c\nWe’ve been training for four whole hours now.\nI’m totally pooped.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Ah, I’m sorry! You all really should take a break.[VAR 0114(0022)]
I’ll go for a run while you rest up![VAR 0114(0022)]
My lady...we four have each trained in our turn—\nbut you, our steadfast mentor, have rested not\r\nonce. I cannot help but worry for thy health.[VAR 0114(0023)]
Thank you for your concern, Atticus.[VAR 0114(0022)]
But lately...I feel like I can take anything.\nEven if I’m really tired or feel like crying.[VAR 0114(0022)]
Remember that time we all got together and\nriffed on the Gym Badge designs to create our\r\nvery own Star Badges?[VAR 0114(0022)]
Well, I don’t know what it is, but just looking at\nmy Star Badge makes me feel so strong...\c\nLike I want to give it my all![VAR 0114(0022)]
I gave my all, but it wasn’t enough—\nI wasn’t enough...[VAR 0114(0022)]
You showed amazing strength.\c\nEven if the code didn’t require me to give it to\nyou, I’d want you to have this.[VAR 0114(0022)]
I’d like to see you try out my trademark move,\ntoo! Here—this one’s for you.[VAR 0114(0022)]
... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0022)]
I know you’re part of Operation Starfall...[VAR 0114(0022)]
But I could tell from our battle that you’re not a\nbad person.[VAR 0114(0022)]
The way your Pokémon look[VAR 1101(00FD,0001)]s at you with such\ntrust gives it away.[VAR 0114(0022)]
Do me a favor and look away for a moment?\nThis is a bit much for me to take...[VAR 0114(0022)]
I just r-really...[VAR 0114(0022)]
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!![VAR 0114(0022)]
Looks like it’s all over.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Oh, Riri...[VAR 0114(003F)]
This is the Team Star member you battled at the\ngates earlier. I asked her to come along for a talk.[VAR 0114(001E)]

You seem to be on much friendlier terms with Eri\ncompared to the other grunts.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Why is that?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Oh, you spotted that?\c\nWell, all right... I don’t mind telling you.[VAR 0114(003F)]
Truth is, I used to hate Riri.[VAR 0114(003F)]
[~ 47]
[~ 48]
She’s an amazing Trainer and athlete—and she’s\nreally pretty, too.[VAR 0114(003F)]
It took her no time at all to become popular at\nthe academy.[VAR 0114(003F)]
I was queen of the class before she came along,\nbut then everyone liked her more than me...[VAR 0114(003F)]
So let me guess...you started to pick on her?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Pretty much. I got our classmates to join in, too...\nWe were all so stupid.[VAR 0114(003F)]
[~ 54]
[~ 55]
But in the end, kids are always fickle—and once\none thrill wears off, they look for something new.[VAR 0114(003F)]
Before long, the class chose me as their next\ntarget and started bullying me instead.[VAR 0114(003F)]
[~ 58]
I guess I deserved it. But then Riri...she chose to\nhelp me even though I’d been so horrible to her.[VAR 0114(003F)]
She told me that she understood how hard it is\nto have no one on your side...\c\nAnd she invited me into Team Star.[VAR 0114(003F)]
Even after you bullied her like that... What a\nkind girl.[VAR 0114(001E)]
She really is. And joining the team has worked\nout great for us. It’s been so much fun![VAR 0114(003F)]
Fun? There are rumors that Team Star likewise\nengages in bullying...[VAR 0114(001E)]
After hearing my story, do you really think\nthat’s true?[VAR 0114(003F)]
Ah, no... I merely...[VAR 0114(001E)]
Riri and the rest of Team Star made me who I\nam today.[VAR 0114(003F)]
Please...don’t take away our greatest treasure.[VAR 0114(003F)]

Normally we’d never be able to get in here to\nsee it for ourselves![VAR 0114(0004)]
Huh...? Wait, where’d [VAR 0101(0001)] go?[VAR 0114(0004)]

Ah, should be all right. The last time I was here...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I caught a Flying Taxi out of the crater. They\nalways come through, if you’re a real sob story...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Why didn’t you just call the professor, if [VAR 1107(00FF,0001)]she’s\ndown here? Don’t get along or something?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Tch! None of your business, pipsqueak.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Everything was going off the rails. School was a\nmess, and my friendships...well, ditto.[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR 0100(0000)] was a big help getting\nall that sorted out.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Guau! So [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she helped you out too while [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she was\ntackling all the Gyms? That’s awesome![VAR 0114(0004)]
What about you then, Nemona?[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR 0100(0000)] and I are classmates!\nNeighbors back home, too![VAR 0114(0004)]
Plus, I said [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she should aim to be a Champion,\nand [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she did it! So now I’ve got a Champion bud![VAR 0114(0004)]
Wait, what?! That’s wild...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hold it right there, you two.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You think YOU’VE got cool friendship origin\nstories with [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
They’re nothing compared to what me and h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer\nwent through! Our friendship’s on another level![VAR 0114(0006)]

[VAR 1107(00FF,0102)]ShHe was always busy with work.\nHardly ever came home.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Really? What kind of Pokémon was it?![VAR 0114(0004)]
It wasn’t even like a Pokémon. More like this\ncrazy-violent, rampaging sort of thing...[VAR 0114(0006)]
It wasn’t even like a Pokémon. More like this\ncrazy-weird, metallic, machine thing...[VAR 0114(0006)]

You sure it wasn’t just a Pokémon that’s a little\nmore, I dunno, roboty than average?[VAR 0114(0004)]

Ugh! No! No way! That’s so not my thing.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Though, yeah...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I guess you could say Mother and Father were,\nlike...hands-off but in a good way?[VAR 0114(0004)]

It was just some weird Pokémon my dad brought\nhome all of a sudden one day.[VAR 0114(0006)]
We all lived together at the lighthouse lab for\na little while.[VAR 0114(0006)]
My [VAR 1107(00FF,0303)]momdad made me promise to keep it a secret.\nAnd I had to take care of it for h[VAR 1107(00FF,0202)]erim, too...[VAR 0114(0006)]
So that’s why you knew so much about it![VAR 0114(0004)]
Yeah, but then one day [VAR 0101(0001)] just\nwent nuts against some wild Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0006)]
A few of the folks living nearby ended up\nseeing it, so the secret was out.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Once that happened, my mom took it—and went\nback to Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Once that happened, my dad took it—and went\nback to Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Guess that makes sense if it’s a Pokémon from a\ndifferent age...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Yeah. If people found out, it’d be all over\nthe news.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I didn’t see my mom or Koraidon again after that.\nFor ages.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I didn’t see my dad or Miraidon again after that.\nFor ages.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Looking back on it now, it seems stupid, but...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I felt like I’d lost my [VAR 1107(00FF,0303)]momdad ’cause of [VAR 1107(00FF,0202)]KoMiraidon.\nIt was the worst feeling ever.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I just hated [VAR 0101(0001)] and everything about it.\nDidn’t want to even talk about it.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Then it lived here awhile with the professor?\nAlong with another one of its kind?[VAR 0114(0004)]
That seems to be the story.[VAR 0114(0008)]
So we...brought it back home, kind of! Or to its\nsecond home, at least![VAR 0114(0004)]
I guess this place should be familiar to it, sure.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Awww, that’s great! A chance to unwind and bask\nin the familiarity![VAR 0114(0004)]
That...doesn’t exactly jibe with how it’s been\nacting all spooked since we got here.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It doesn’t seem eager to come out of its ball\nanytime soon, either.[VAR 0114(0006)]

It was the same for me when I was being ignored\nby everyone in my class.[VAR 0114(0008)]

Aw, Penny...[VAR 0114(0004)]
So...maybe it got hurt down here in Area Zero,\njust like Mabosstiff?[VAR 0114(0006)]
We can’t know for sure, but...it doesn’t change\ninto its battle form anymore, right?[VAR 0114(0008)]
So I think it’s possible.[VAR 0114(0008)]
But that’s so sad! We gotta do something to\nmake it feel better![VAR 0114(0004)]

Enigmas of Paldea, File #09\nGreat Tusk: A Living Relic of the Dinosaur Era?!
In one arid corner of Paldea, there have been\nreports of a mysterious life-form. It’s said to\nresemble a Donphan at first glance, albeit one\nwith gigantic tusks, tough scales, and an\naggressive disposition.
Leading theories hold that this being is nothing\nless than a living relic of the dinosaur era, but\nno one can say for sure. Apparently, it’s called\nGreat Tusk after the name of a strange being that\nwas written about in the mysterious Scarlet Book.
Enigmas of Paldea, File #09\nIron Treads: An Alien Weapon?!
In one arid corner of Paldea, there have been\nreports of a mysterious life-form. It’s said to\nresemble a Donphan at first glance, albeit one\nthat can abruptly assume a spherical shape and\nlaunch into a swift rolling attack.
Rumors say this being is some kind of weapon\nusing technology not of this world, but no one\ncan say for sure. Apparently, it’s called Iron\nTreads after the name of a strange being that was\nwritten about in the mysterious Violet Book.

Enigmas of Paldea, File #10\nScream Tail: A Billion-Year-Old Jigglypuff?!
Somewhere in a Paldean forest, it’s said, lurks\nScream Tail—a being with Jigglypuff’s own\nendearing puffball appearance but also a\nferocious aggression that leads it to attack\nanyone who comes near.
Its primitive appearance and savage nature have\nprompted rumors that it could be a Jigglypuff\nfrom one billion years ago. It’s named after a\ncreature in the Scarlet Book that is described as\nhaving a distinctive tail and scream.
Enigmas of Paldea, File #10\nIron Bundle: An Ancient Civilization’s Robot?!
The mysterious Violet Book makes reference to a\nbeing called Iron Bundle, which was said to look\nlike Delibird and to possess a spherical apparatus\nfrom which it would fire huge blasts of ice to\npropel itself through snowy lands.
Plenty of theories about it have been floated. A\nleading one suggests it is the product of a long-\ngone civilization—a notion supported by ancient\nwritings that describe the design and usage of\nmachines resembling Iron Bundle.

There have been precious few sightings reported\nof the ultra-mysterious Slither Wing, a being\nwhose name is taken from that of a similar-\nseeming creature described in the ever-puzzling\nScarlet Book.
Slither Wing shares traits with Volcarona, so some\ntheorize that it may have been revived from\nfossils from a prehistoric era that we have\ndiscussed in these pages. However, no Volcarona\nfossils of that era are known to have been found.
Enigmas of Paldea, File #08\nIron Moth: A UFO Sent to Spy on Humankind?!
The name Iron Moth was borrowed from that of a\nflying object described in the era-defining Violet\nBook. It was said to resemble Volcarona and\nwould descend from the skies, following people\naround and occasionally even attacking them.
Some point to Iron Moth’s aggression as a sign\nthat it is, in fact, a UFO of sorts being controlled\nby alien life. Perhaps something out there is using\nIron Moth to observe us, waiting for the moment\nto mount an invasion...

It’s said that Sandy Shocks is an aggressive sort\nand that some people who’ve seen it have been\nattacked as well. It takes its name from a beast\nwith a matching description in the era-defining\nScarlet Book.

This flying life-form bearing a resemblance to\nHydreigon has been seen in a certain corner of\nPaldea. It was reported to have razed an entire\nbuilding with a high-energy blast, then flown off\nas if to find its next objective.
Iron Jugulis is theorized to be a sort of machine-\nHydreigon hybrid, as it combines the former’s\nruthlessness with the latter’s ferocity. It takes\nits name from a similarly described entity in\nthe Violet Book.
There’s a magazine entitled “Occulture.” It’s the\nJune issue. Do you want to read it?
Enigmas of Paldea, File #06\nBrute Bonnet: Amoonguss Meets Dinosaur?
This bizarre creature is said to combine traits of\ndinosaurs with those of the Pokémon Amoonguss.\nIt’s named after a fierce mushroom creature of\nmatching description that appears in the\nrenowned Scarlet Book.
Brute Bonnet certainly resembles Amoonguss,\nthough with its own unique twists: its gigantic\nstature and seemingly low intelligence combine\nto make it a savage, powerful fighter.
Enigmas of Paldea, File #06\nIron Thorns: A Tyranitar of the Distant Future?!
A strange being called Iron Thorns has been\nsighted in a certain cave in Paldea. This being\nbears a strong resemblance to Tyranitar, but it\napparently displays great coolheadedness and\nprefers to avoid unnecessary fights.
It appears to be highly intelligent and clad in\nmetallic armor, causing some to speculate that it\nmay be a Tyranitar as it would appear a billion\nyears from now. Its name comes from a similarly\ndescribed entity that appears in the Violet Book.
There’s a magazine entitled “Occulture.” It’s the\nMay issue. Do you want to read it?
Enigmas of Paldea, File #05\nFlutter Mane: A Ghostly Pterosaur?!
Flutter Mane—a name taken from a strange\ncreature with a matching description appearing in\nthe Scarlet Book—is said to float around the sky\nat night with its long hair writhing about it.
Eyewitness accounts describe it as resembling a\ngiant Misdreavus at first glance, albeit a highly\nfierce and aggressive one. Some believe that it’s\na ghost of a pterosaur from a long-gone era.
Enigmas of Paldea, File #05\nIron Hands: Secretly a Cyborg?!
This being’s name comes from the one given to\nan iron-handed entity in the mysterious Violet\nBook. It is said to have fists that move\nindependent of its body and to be capable of\nthrowing large, fast-moving vehicles.
A leading theory holds that Iron Hands was once\nan athlete who became mortally wounded but\nwas kept alive by being made into a cyborg.\nWhy it so strongly resembles Hariyama, however,\nremains unanswered.
There’s a magazine entitled “Occulture.” It’s the\nApril issue. Do you want to read it?
Enigmas of Paldea, File #04\nRoaring Moon: A Primeval Salamence?!
This elusive creature is called Roaring Moon after\na similarly described being in the Scarlet Book. It\nlooks similar to Salamence when they undergo a\ncertain phenomenon elsewhere in the world, but\nit’s unclear if there is any connection.
This creature scatters feathers as it flies around at\nhigh speeds seeking prey. It’s thought to be more\nsavage than Salamence, and if you should\nencounter one, it’s imperative that you avoid\nactual contact.
Enigmas of Paldea, File #04\nIron Valiant: An Experiment Gone Wrong?!
This oddity’s name is borrowed from that of an\nobject described in the Violet Book. One theory\nholds that it is in fact a robot—the product of a\nmad scientist’s efforts to create the most\npowerful psychic Pokémon of all.
According to its few eyewitnesses, Iron Valiant\nappears similar to both Gardevoir and Gallade.\nIt’s also said to be cruel enough to take its\nbrilliantly shining blade and cut down anyone\nconfronting it without hesitation.

We’ve determined that this energy crystallization\nis linked to the being we call ▉▉▉▉▉▉.\c\nThe interlocking hexagonal plates that comprise\n▉▉▉▉▉▉’s shell must somehow cause this\r\nphenomenon—which I’ve dubbed “Terastallizing.”
Thanks to my prototype Tera Orb, I secured\ncorporate funding for my research and made\r\na laboratory in the lighthouse near Cabo Poco.\c\nSomeday, though, I’ll return to the crater and\nresume my study of these crystals.
At last I can resume work on the Tera Project!\c\nI’ll move my research to the Zero Lab this month.\nMy team will be smaller, but no matter.\c\nThe strong influence of the crystals makes our\nexperiments much more unstable.
The crystals’ power is tremendous! Their unstable\noutput made our corporate backers fret, but...\c\nIf we can harness this energy, it will open up\nresearch possibilities we’d only dreamed of.\c\nAt last, paradise will be ours to create.
Our time machine research has yielded a\ntriumph—a Pokémon from the ancient past!\c\nI’ve named it Koraidon.\c\nI was expecting one new life to treasure, but\nwhat fortune to be blessed with this gift as well!

We’re all ready to Terastallize! Time to activate\nmy Tera Orb.[VAR 0114(002A)]

I should not be the one saying au revoir to the\naudience after this battle... That should be you![VAR 0114(0026)]
Do you want to see what I’m capable of? You do,\ndon’t you?[VAR 0114(0026)]

This is the famous, torturously long staircase of\nthe academy! Not an easy climb, is it?
Mesagoza is like a full table—it’s got the school,\nit’s got culture, it’s got everything!
There are lots of different people and Pokémon\nat the school—and you’re part of the variety!
Those Team Star kids are a little scary, don’t\nyou think?
I hear that Team Star races around every night,\nriding on weird cars of some kind.
You get to choose which classes you want to take\nat the academy, right? Schools are so different\r\nfrom when I was a student...
Hello? Yes, the students here are just the best.\nA huge help to everyone, really!
They don’t call it the biggest city in Paldea for\nnothing! I’ve gotten myself completely lost!
The green arrow in your map app points north!\nTo lock your map’s orientation so that north’s\r\nalways at the top, press the Right Stick!
The Pokémon League’s through that tunnel, right?\c\nThat’s where you get tested to see if you can\nbecome a Champion!
I just had my interview at the Pokémon League!\nThe interviewer was real scary, though...
Outside the city, you’ll run into tons of Pokémon\nthat you’ve never seen before!
You know Tulip the supermodel, right? Well,\napparently she’s a childhood friend of one of\r\nthe teachers at the academy!
There are tons of hills and cliffs up ahead. Be\ncareful not to get lost, OK?\c\nOnce you get through, you’ll reach Artazon, the\ntown of nature and art!
A famous professor unraveled the secrets of the\nTerastal phenomenon.
I hear the professor’s doing some amazing\nresearch at the Great Crater of Paldea...
Each night’s sleep brings you one day closer to\nschool! So make sure to get lots of sleep!
I wanna go to the big school too!
Time passes, weather changes...\c\nI hear wild Pokémon behave differently too,\ndepending on the weather and time of day.
This pond is huge!\c\nI wanna float around in it just like a Magikarp!
I feel like school teachers always get weird\nnicknames from their students.\c\nI keep hearing kids mentioning names like\n“Old Hass” and “Brovatore.”
Some Pokémon can’t learn certain moves!
I wanted to get a Tera Orb of my very own but\nmy grades weren’t quite good enough...
You have to be a good student to get a Tera Orb.\nThey’re too powerful to be given out willy-nilly.
This is Mesagoza, the biggest city in Paldea!
Sagu’s home ec is a really useful class to take!
Ms. Rai’s history classes are so much fun!
Now, which sandwich shop should we eat\nat today?
Shops in the same chain still have slightly\ndifferent menus depending on their location!
The Pokémon you see around town are usually\nsomebody’s partner. It’s best you don’t try to\r\ncatch them!
My Pokémon’s really sensitive to sounds!
Pokémon of the same species can still have\ndifferent strengths, natures, and even Abilities.
Rain in Paldea isn’t that cold and it stops really\nquickly, so nobody here uses an umbrella.
My son told me he’d joined some group called\nTeam Star. I have no idea what kind of sports\r\nteam that is, but I’m sure it’s very fun!
Look at this battle court right here in the\ncentral plaza!\c\nIt takes a lot of courage to battle here, since\nthere’s always going to be quite an audience!
I heard that other regions only have one\nChampion!\c\nIt’s really cool that Paldea has so many\nChampion-ranked Trainers, don’t you think?
I’m not a huge fan of shopping online... Nothing\nbeats being able to see the product firsthand.
Did you know? You can have up to six Pokémon\non your team!
Any Pokémon beyond the six on your team get\nsent to your Boxes, right?
If I gather up the materials dropped by Pokémon\nand trade them in for LP, I can buy what I want...\r\neven if I don’t have any money!
Mesagooozaaa, the city of leeeaaarning! ♪\nI studied at the school, my passion buuurning! ♪
The entrance hall of the school is full of books,\nand you’re free to read as many as you’d like.\r\nIt’s a great place for any bookworm!
I’m a graduate of the academy, you know!\nI wonder if they still do that Treasure Hunt thing.
The academy doesn’t have any age restrictions—\neven my grandma could enroll! Maybe this is a\r\ngood chance to redo my own studies!
The west gate is this way! Head out from there if\nyou want to go to Cortondo!
The west gate is down the other path—the one\npast the canned goods store!
This way’s a dead end! All you’ll find down there\nis the Go-for-Broke Grill!
I better get ready for the Treasure Hunt.\nNow where was Delibird Presents...?
There are a few Delibird Presents in this city.\nYou’ll run into one if you just head south.
It’s such a relief when there’s a Pokémon Center\nnearby. I like the music they play, too.
You can use a Flying Taxi to get back to any\nPokémon Center you’ve been to before!
So what’s the difference between a town and a\ncity anyway? Is it the size...?
There are three big cities here in Paldea! One of\nthem is where we are now—Mesagoza!
I heard there were unusual sandwiches being sold\naround here, but...where?
Sandwiches are so good! I wanna have one\nevery day!
Hee hee! Do you want to try making sandwiches\ntogether sometime?
The north side of the city is mostly residential.\c\nSeems they don’t let you live in the student dorm\nif you’re from Mesagoza. Makes sense, really.
It makes me so happy just to see someone\nwalking around with their Pokémon.
I love sandwiches! But this store’s sandwiches are\na particular favorite!
If you get a smartphone case at Delibird Presents,\nyou can change how your Rotom Phone looks!\r\nSo many choices... Which one should I go for?
Once I catch my own Pokémon, I’m gonna\nbecome a Champion-ranked Trainer!
Are star-shaped shades popular at the school?\nI saw a group of students all wearing them.
Each town’s battle court has a different color\nand look to it, you know?
That nice lady at the Pokémon Center always\ngives me little tips when my Pokémon get healed.\r\nIs it just me? D’you think she likes me?!
I’m having my Pachirisu hold an item I bought at\nDelibird Presents!\c\nPokémon can get all sorts of perks from the item\nthey hold, you know?
Good things can happen from time to time if you\nlet your Pokémon hold a Quick Claw!\c\nThey have ’em for sale there at the red shop!
You can reach Cortondo if you head out the west\ngate and just keep going. They have their harvest\r\nfestival around this time of year.
Bronzong is so soothing...\c\nIt lets me get inside it from time to time. It’s the\nmost calming, peaceful experience...
Well, I’m completely lost. Time to boot up the\nold map app.
Some meals here will fill you with Egg Power!\c\nThat’ll make it easier for you to find Pokémon\nEggs when you’re out on a picnic!
You can exchange materials dropped by\nPokémon for LP at the TM Machine!
Machines these days are so talkative! Even the\nTM Machine’s real chatty, don’t you think?
Pachirisu’s Ability is Run Away! It’s real good at\ngetting away from wild Pokémon!
Huh. Vending machines these days let you buy a\ndrink with LP too, eh?
The staircase in front of the school is famous for\nbeing torturously long. I certainly don’t envy the\r\nstudents who have to climb it regularly!
If you come across a sleeping wild Pokémon,\nthat’s a great chance to get the drop on it!
Whenever I see sleeping Pokémon, I can’t stop\nsnapping photos of them!
What was the new director’s name...Mr. Clavell?\nHe became director about a year and a half ago.
Do you know Nemona, the student council\npresident? She’s such a sweet young lady.\r\nShe always says hi when she passes by!
If you come across a beautiful view, don’t forget\nto snap a picture with the camera app.
Are you also the type that likes to chill out on\nrooftops? Well, make sure you don’t fall off.
You can buy academy-approved bags in various\ncolors at this shop!\c\nNow, which color should I choose...?
I need to get my hair styled at Salon Renacer.\nCould you kill some time around here?
Side part, romantic tuck...\c\nThey have some hair styles that almost sound like\nPokémon moves!
Maybe I’ll buy some glasses at the Spec Shack\nand get a new, bespectacled look!
I want to wear a stylish hat! But I also want\npeople to notice my hair!\c\n...Guess I’ll make up my mind inside the shop.
If you get cold feet easily, you need some nice,\nthick socks—and this shop has a great selection!
They’ve got fruit, vegetables, and even rice!\c\nSure Cans is where to go if you want to buy a ton\nof food and make heaps of sandwiches!

Good thing we had our Cyclizar to get us across\nthe Asado Desert!
Let’s give both our Cyclizar a nice wash to clean\noff all that sand.
I love my Marill just the way she is, so whenever\nshe starts to evolve, I do a lucky chant to stop it.\c\n“B Button! Put the brakes on this Evolution!”\nIt works every time!
Cascarrafa’s battle court is sunk right into\nthe river!
If you want to head to the upper tiers, just wait\nin front of the elevator here for a moment.
The river gets pretty deep up ahead! ’Course, if\nyou can move across the water, you’re all set!
Porto Marinada is across this desert! Make sure\nyou’re prepared for the trip if you plan to go.
I...I saw a tiny little Pokémon holding a coin!\nWhen I got close, it dropped the coin and ran!\r\nWhat even WAS that thing?
Maybe I should buy something for my Pokémon\nbefore heading home...
Why don’t Pokémon like to eat the same things\nI like to eat? I don’t get it.
The walls look just like cascades of water! I bet\nthey could help train Pokémon to use Waterfall!
Coming from Zapapico, I’m amazed to see how\nmuch water there is around here!\c\nIt’s a precious resource where I’m from.
Marill really love the water! They’re Water-type\nPokémon after all!
Whenever I can’t decide what to eat, I always\nfind myself coming to Jade Palace Garden.
This spot is for Cyclizar to rest and recharge.\c\nIt’s the least we can do to thank them for carrying\nus around.
They call Cascarrafa the City of Water! I’m sure\nyou can see why!
The restaurants here are supposed to be really\ngood! I hear it’s because most of ’em use fresh\r\ningredients brought in from Porto Marinada!
I want to travel all over the place and take lots of\nphotos while I’m still young.\c\nWhen I’m a little old grandma, I’ll look through\nthem all and remember the good ol’ days.
Seems like the Kofu Lounge is the most renowned\neatery in Cascarrafa!
I want to go to the sandwich restaurant on the\nupper level!
I’m clueless when it comes to map reading...\nWhich way is north again?
North is shown by the green arc in your map app.\nWhy not try locking it so north always points up?
Cascarrafa was built on the side of these cliffs!\nThat’s why the city has multiple tiers.
Hoo boy, what a shopping spree! Where should\nwe head to next?
Let’s hit the market in Porto Marinada and shop\ntill we drop!
Oh, Cascarrafa, city of waterrr... ♪\nCarafes are vessels for water, etceteraaa! ♪
I heard that before they installed elevators here,\nyou had to ride Cyclizar up and down these cliffs\r\nto reach the different tiers! Sounds rough!
It seems only especially talented people are\nallowed to have one of those Tera Orbs that let\r\nyou Terastallize Pokémon.
They say that Pokémon can only Terastallize in\nPaldea. Now why on earth might that be?
Regular folk like us aren’t allowed to set foot\ninside the Great Crater of Paldea...\c\nI wonder what kind of Pokémon are down there?
Stop on by the Kofu Lounge! The renowned\nrestaurant of Gym Leader Kofu is right here!
People love coming to Cascarrafa to take photos.\nIt’s such a beautiful city!
You’re going to school next year, too, right?\nYou think we’ll make lotsa friends?
I can’t wait to live in the school dorms! I won’t\nget told off for eating candy before bed!
Tourists started flocking here after we added lots\nof blue around the city.\c\nThe idea apparently came from Kofu himself\na few years ago.
Every kind of sandwich, any way you want!\nCome on over to Every Wich Way!
Cascarrafa’s Gym Test is a real doozy!
Kofu is the face of Cascarrafa! He’s usually a\nmild, easygoing guy, but he shows off his cool\r\nside when he’s doing his Gym Leader thing!
I’d love to do a big bicycle trip sometime, but\nPaldea has too many mountains and valleys.
I heard they ride Pokémon other than Cyclizar\nin other regions. Wonder if that’s true?
I’ve worked my tail off this month... That means\nI can treat myself to a designer handbag, right?
I fancied trying out a new style, so I changed up\nmy hair! Don’t you think it suits me?
Errr... Did you get your bangs trimmed?

How are you liking Levincia? Business and tech\nare what we pride ourselves on!
The city’s main street is just north of here!\c\nNothing says “Wow, I’m in Levincia!” like being\nslapdab in the middle of all those neon signs.
Since we wear socks day in, day out, they just\ngotta be comfy as can be!
I don’t care if a bag can’t fit much inside, as long\nas it’s stylish!
So this is Iono’s Gym... I’ve seen it in her videos\nso many times—I can’t believe I’m actually here!
Did you see the latest episode of Iono Zone?\nThat collab with Tulip was great!
Iono’s super cute, isn’t she? She’s the most\npopular streamer around, hands down!
Having greenery around the city is good for our\nwell-being. Sure helps me feel less stressed.
Life in Levincia is exhilarating. There’s always\nsomething going on!
Right! Ultra Balls—you got it!\c\nYup, they outperform Great Balls on all counts,\nso I’ll go ahead and put in an order for 300!
When I grow up, I wanna be an inflooenser too!
You can make a living doing all sorts of things\nthese days!
I went to make a sandwich, but I’d run clean out\nof picks! Would you believe it? I go through ’em\r\nso fast, I’d better buy ’em in bulk from now on.
I could go for the Treasure Eatery in Medali, but\nCascarrafa’s Kofu Lounge also sounds good.\r\nShould we call a Flying Taxi?
I’m headed out to catch Pokémon later, so I want\nto eat something that’ll give me Catching Power!
I’m gonna wait till that Pokémon’s flying riiight\nover the ocean, and theeen...SNAP!
There’s boats ’n’ stuff down there! I wish I could\nsail to the bottom of the sea!
Levincia feels nice and safe thanks to all the\nsecurity cameras about the place!\c\nI hear the footage they capture is used for the\nGym Test.
Pottery classes in Alfornada—I’m telling you,\nthat should be our next big project!
Livestreamed Pokémon battles can be fun to\nwatch, but I want to see them in person, too!
Ryme’s new track just dropped! I gotta check it\nout ASAP!
Everything in Tulip’s limited-edition line of\nmakeup is so lovely! I’m spoiled for choice!
These skyscrapers are crazy tall! My neck hurts\njust trying to take ’em all in!
Apparently, all five of these buildings are owned\nby a real estate firm called Paldea Realty.
This city’s electricity is generated by a species of\nPokémon called Tadbulb! What hard workers!
M-my idol! He’s on the neon signs!!! He pops up\non one screen, then the next...then ANOTHER!\r\nOooh, Brassius...I’m your biggest fan!!!
You can use a TM Machine to create any TM that\nyou’ve ever gotten before!
If you had a Pokémon you could ride over water,\nyou could leap into the ocean without a care!
Levincia started out as a port town that shipped\nore from the mines to various other places.\c\nIt’s hard to believe that humble port went on to\nbecome the high-flying business hub it is today!
Where did the name Levincia come from? Is it\nfrom that old word “levin”? Or “leviathan”?\c\nOr maybe, ’cause the city has all these soaring\nbuildings in its Million Volt Skyline, could it be\r\nfrom “leaven”? Like, you know, rising bread?
You remember that famous professor? Haven’t\nseen h[VAR 1107(00FF,0202)]erim on TV or in the papers for a while...
I heard [VAR 1107(00FF,0001)]she has some sort of lab at the base of\nthe lighthouse over by Cabo Poco.
Changing up your look also changes up your\nwhole mood!\c\nYour day can go all sorts of ways depending on\nthe clothes you wear.
OK, we got Potions, sandwich ingredients,\nPoké Balls... Hope we didn’t forget anything!
We can always take a Flying Taxi back to the\nPoké Mart if we need to.
[~ 35]
Iono started out as a streamer quite a few years\nago now... Just how old is she, anyway?
My Luxio’s fur has a nice sheen to it, huh?\nI always give it a wash first thing after a battle.
One day, when I’m all grown up and rich, I’ll say\nto the shop man “I’ll take the lot!”
*munch munch*\c\nI heard the Levincia Gym livestreams the Gym\nTests of all its challengers!
*gulp gulp*\c\nI watched the Gym’s livestream of a Trainer\nnamed Nemona. Her Pokémon were awesome!
I heard the academy has mountains of books!\c\nWhen I start studying there, I’m gonna read every\nsingle issue of Occulture!
If you climb the lighthouse up ahead, you’ll get\na great view over the whole city of Levincia!
I like photos of scenic places as much as anyone,\nbut the most memorable photos for me are\r\nalways ones of people or Pokémon.

Very well, Champion Nemona. I trust you to\nhandle this in my stead.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Sure thing! You can count on me. In fact, I bet\nthis is gonna be fun![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m glad to hear it. Good day, then.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Oh—pardon me.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Hey![VAR 0114(0004)]
Who was that?
She looked awesome!

Now, I know you said you’re all about completing\nthe Pokédex! But hear me out...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, since your heart’s already set on becoming\na really strong Trainer...I’ve got an idea for you![VAR 0114(0004)]
If you’re still trying to decide what it is you’re\nlooking for...I’ve got an idea for you![VAR 0114(0004)]
You should try to reach [VAR FF00(0006)]Champion Rank[VAR FF00(0000)] like me![VAR 0114(0004)]
Yeah, I will!
I don’t know...
Oh wow! Hang on, though—I’ve got a whole spiel\nI wanna give you. Here goes...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Aww, but talent like yours deserves to be used!\nHear me out...[VAR 0114(0004)]
The Trainers who reach Champion Rank are the\nones who raise their Pokémon really strong.\c\nThey’re pro-tier battlers. Their moves keep\ncrowds absolutely on the edge of their seats![VAR 0114(0004)]
You have to prove yourself to the Pokémon\nLeague to officially get the title of Champion.[VAR 0114(0004)]
And to do that, you have to do more than just\ntake classes here.\c\nYou’ve got to take on eight Pokémon Gyms and\nwin so you can collect their Gym Badges![VAR 0114(0004)]
Once you’ve done all that, all that’s left is a\nspecial test—the Champion Assessment.[VAR 0114(0004)]
And once you pass THAT, then at long last you’ll\nbe a Champion![VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s every Pokémon Trainer’s dream! The coolest\ntitle anyone could ever hope to get!\c\nNot to brag or anything![VAR 0114(0004)]
I reached Champion Rank during our last\nTreasure Hunt, you know![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, the Treasure Hunt is a special independent\nstudy thing we’ve got here. Should happen soon!\c\nOur last one started not long after the beginning\nof this school year![VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s great! You get to leave school to go have an\nadventure and learn however you want![VAR 0114(0004)]
I guess you could say my journey to becoming\na Champion was the treasure I found...maybe?\r\nI dunno yet if that’s the answer I’m looking for...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyway, I’ve got a feeling I’d be able to get even\nstronger if you and I were both working at it...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Lemme go ahead and save the Gyms’ locations in\nyour map app in case you decide to go for it![VAR 0114(0004)]

Well, now! [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0012)]
You appear to be progressing well on your\nGym circuit.[VAR 0114(0012)]
What’s this now? Is this that kid I’ve been hearing\nso much about?[VAR 0114(002C)]
Hey, kiddo! I heard you’re, like, way too good\nat battling! Yeah?[VAR 0114(002C)]
Yeah!
Not THAT good...
Nahaha! You got some spirit, big shot![VAR 0114(002C)]
Pah! You can’t fool me that easily. No need to\nplay humble, you hear?[VAR 0114(002C)]
This young lady would be Rika.[VAR 0114(0012)]
That’s me! Rika here, at your service.[VAR 0114(0013)]
And hey, I know I’m pretty, but no need to get\nintimidated or anything.[VAR 0114(0013)]
She is a little...farcical, shall we say. But like\nmyself, she is a member of the Elite Four.[VAR 0114(0012)]
What? I wasn’t tryin’ to be funny...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Aaanyway... Hmm.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Tell you something, kiddo—you look fun.\nLike, interesting. At a glance, anyway.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Naturally. [VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe is one of our academy’s esteemed\nstudents.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Oooh, haha. Yeah, that checks out.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But the battles you’ll face at these Gyms really\nratchet up the farther you go.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Indeed. Your average Trainer abandons the\nchallenge at roughly this very point.[VAR 0114(0012)]
But not you, right, kiddo?[VAR 0114(0013)]
See you when you hit the Champion Assessment.\nYou show these Gyms what you’ve got![VAR 0114(0013)]
Best of fortunes to you.[VAR 0114(0012)]

Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Hola![VAR 0114(0004)]
Caught you just as you finished up in here, huh?\nNice work![VAR 0114(0004)]
That puts you four badges in now, right? Man,\nthat’s awesome![VAR 0114(0004)]
I can’t believe you’re halfway through your Gym\njourney already! Your efforts are bearing so much\r\nfruit so quickly![VAR 0114(0004)]
It makes me wanna just challenge you to a battle\nright here, right now!\c\nBut...I’m gonna have to wait.[VAR 0114(0004)]
’Cause I put together my team of Pokémon\nspecifically to take on the Gym Leader... Dang it![VAR 0114(0004)]
When I battle you, I wanna do it under the best\npossible conditions! Which means this time, I’ve\r\ngotta ask for a rain check.[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Guhhh, this is the worst timing ever!\nSorry, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
Forgive me! Forgive meee![VAR 0114(0004)]

Heeey, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
I saw you going into the Gym and came running![VAR 0114(0004)]
Listen, I’m really sorry I couldn’t battle you last\ntime we ran into each other.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Wait—don’t get me wrong! I didn’t chase you\ndown just to battle you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Then again...I guess I wouldn’t MIND a battle or\nanything, if you wanted to... What do you say?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Sure!
Maybe not
[VAR BD06(0000)]Yesss! Battle tiiime! You and me,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
C’mon! It’ll just be, like, a really short battle!\nI’ll only use four Pokémon! I promise![VAR 0114(0004)]
Wait, hold on... I wanna be sure to pick the right\nPokémon for where you’re at in your journey.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Sorry, gimme a sec to fine-tune my team! Then\nwe can battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
In fact, while you’re waiting, go ahead and take\non the Gym![VAR 0114(0004)]

Another Gym Leader defeated. Well done.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Rika informed me that there was an unusual\nTrainer worth keeping an eye on.[VAR 0114(0011)]
It seems she meant you. I’d guessed as much.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I had the pleasure of observing your last match.\nI was impressed by the fantastic skill you showed![VAR 0114(0011)]
If you manage to keep your momentum and\nachieve Champion Rank...[VAR 0114(0011)]
I will be very interested in inviting you to the\nPokémon League and—[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hey hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’ve got my\nteam\r\nall\r\npicked out![VAR 0114(0004)]
And I saw you battling the Gym Leader! You just\nkeep getting better![VAR 0114(0004)]
How good to see you again, Champion Nemona.\nIt has certainly been a while.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Whoa! Wait! La Primera?\nWith [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Why do you call her that?
Is she that important?
Wait, did I forget to give you the full\nexplanation?![VAR 0114(0004)]
Everyone calls Ms. Geeta “La Primera” because\nshe’s just that—she’s the real number one, even\r\nhigher than us regular Champions...[VAR 0114(0004)]
She’s the [VAR FF00(0006)]Top Champion[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
I do indeed hold that claim. Alongside my role\nas chairwoman of the Pokémon League, that is.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I thought you were too busy to spend your time\nchecking in on Gyms![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m not here to inspect the Gym. I’ve come to\nscout some rather promising young talent.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Whoaaa. I look away for one second and you’re\nfamous, [VAR 0100(0000)]?![VAR 0114(0004)]
But hey—I found [VAR 0100(0000)] first!\c\nYou may be La Primera, but you can’t go stealing\nh[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer from me![VAR 0114(0004)]
Haha. I suppose I’ll have to get in line.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That’s right! C’mon, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nTime\r\nfor\r\nour battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
Quick, let’s gooo! The battlefield’s callin’![VAR 0114(0004)]
[~ 23]
One moment, please.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Huh? What is it?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I would very much like to observe this match,\nif that is all right.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Oooh, haha! Totally fine by me![VAR 0114(0004)]
Sounds fun, right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Thank you kindly. I’m already excited to see you\ntwo face off.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Oh, there’s no need to be nervous. Just pretend\nI’m not even around.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Let’s be on our way, then.[VAR 0114(0011)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : champ_0110.dat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You remember how it all works, right? Once you\nget badges from all the Gyms...[VAR 0114(0004)]
you get to throw down against the strongest\nPokémon Trainers around![VAR 0114(0004)]
Yes. You must face the Pokémon League.[VAR 0114(0011)]
It is located to the northwest of Mesagoza.[VAR 0114(0011)]
The Pokémon League is where Trainers are\nreborn as Champions—the greatest honor that\r\nthey might dream of.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Collecting eight Gym Badges sets you up to\ntake the Champion Assessment.[VAR 0114(0004)]
If you can face the challenge of the final\nexaminer and win, you’ll become a Champion![VAR 0114(0004)]
Just imagine how that moment would feel.\nTry getting into that Champion mindset![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now, set your sights on reaching that big,\nimportant stage...and let’s battl—[VAR 0114(0004)]
Excuse me one moment.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I believe [VAR 0100(0000)]’s\nPokémon\r\nmay\r\nstill\r\nbe\r\na\r\nlittle\r\nfatigued.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Sorry! Got a little caught up in my battle hunger.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, you should all be in great shape now thanks\nto La Primera![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]OK, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Time to put\nour\r\ngame\r\nfaces\r\nback on![VAR 0114(0004)]
Let’s have us another fruitful battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
An amazing display of talent, even against one\nas skilled as Champion Nemona.[VAR 0114(0011)]
That was a splendid match. I enjoyed watching\nvery much.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Now even La Primera thinks you’re one to watch.\nYou’ve got so much potential![VAR 0114(0004)]
The way you’re going, I better watch my back![VAR 0114(0004)]
Did battling in front of La Primera give you the\njitters, maybe?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, I might’ve won, but it was obvious how\nmuch you’ve bonded with your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0004)]
Y’know, since the first time we met, I’ve been\nweirdly sure of one thing...[VAR 0114(0004)]
You’re gonna become a Champion—no doubt\nabout it, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
The rest of these Gyms? You can take ’em!\nHundred percent, no problem![VAR 0114(0004)]
I agree. In fact, you should take this. Consider it\nan investment in your future.[VAR 0114(0011)]
If a Pokémon uses that move while Terastallized,\nthe move’s type will change to the Tera Type\r\nof the Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]One day, [VAR 0100(0000)], you and\nme\r\nare\r\ngonna\r\nhave\r\nthe\r\ngreatest\r\nbattle\r\nof\r\nall!\r\nI know it![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m gonna go train up—even more than I already\nhave been![VAR 0114(0004)]
She shows you such support and friendship.\nOr perhaps...\c\nPerhaps she hopes you truly might rival her?[VAR 0114(0011)]
No... I think it’s no mere hope. She seems to have\ncomplete faith that you will catch up to her.[VAR 0114(0011)]
At any rate, allow me to return you to the Gym\nwhere I found you.[VAR 0114(0011)]

Hello, hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(002A)]
How goes your Treasure Hunt? Figured out what\nyou’re hunting for yet?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Sure have!
I have no idea...
That’s great! Look at you, knowing exactly what\nyou’re after![VAR 0114(002A)]
Haha. I get it. Director Clavell doesn’t like\nquestions with easy answers, does he?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Many students choose to make the Gym circuit a\npart of their Treasure Hunt.[VAR 0114(002A)]
It’s no easy feat, but even making the attempt is\na worthwhile experience.[VAR 0114(002A)]
That’s why I was waiting here—to make sure you\nknow your homeroom teacher’s got your back![VAR 0114(002A)]
This should be handy for your Treasure Hunt.[VAR 0114(002A)]
I hope you’ll keep working on that Pokédex of\nyours too—since I did make the app and all![VAR 0114(002A)]
That’s all from me. Just do your best and keep\nout of danger, OK?[VAR 0114(002A)]

Greetings once more, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
I was watching your battle with the Gym Leader\nfrom the sidelines, and I must say...[VAR 0114(0012)]
I thought it was simply excellent! Full marks!\nGold star! Extra credit, even![VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hardly had you sent out [VAR 0101(0001)]\nbefore\r\nyou\r\nlaunched\r\ninto\r\nyour strategy![VAR 0114(0012)]
That unrelenting offensive! That flurry of attacks!\nWhat an efficient way to corner the opponent![VAR 0114(0012)]
And what [VAR 1101(00FD,0003)]an artfully trained Pokémon! Such a\nvibrant palette of moves![VAR 0114(0012)]
Ah! I do beg your pardon. I didn’t mean to let\nmy emotions run amok like that.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Ahem! In summary, I simply wanted to say that\nyou seem to have gotten even stronger.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I must admit I’m eager for you to gather all\nthe Gym Badges.[VAR 0114(0012)]
As a member of the Elite Four, I await the day\nyou come to face me with great anticipation![VAR 0114(0012)]
Oh, but one thing—don’t let your studies fall by\nthe wayside. Be sure to come to the academy\r\nnow and then![VAR 0114(0012)]

Hey, I heard the good news! Congrats on Gym\nBadge number six![VAR 0114(0004)]
Not even a tenth of the Trainers who take on\nthe Gyms get this far, y’know![VAR 0114(0004)]
But I’m not surprised that you made it. I just\nKNEW there was a reason you caught my eye![VAR 0114(0004)]
Thanks!
I don’t know...
Oh please! I should be the one thanking you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, trust me—I could tell from our very first\nbattle you were gonna grow seriously strong![VAR 0114(0004)]
Aaanyway...I bet you could use a little warming\nup before you take on the Gym, huh?[VAR 0114(0004)]
C’mon! You know the drill by now![VAR 0114(0004)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : champ_0128.dat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ta-ta-tachán! Here’s our battle court for today![VAR 0114(0004)]
OK, right... Mm-hmm! Always important to check\nwhat environment your Pokémon’ll be battling in![VAR 0114(0004)]
The battlefield can have these teeny effects on\nyour Pokémon’s balance and stuff, y’know?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyway, sorry I sorta dragged you here. But a\nlittle pre-Gym warming up should do you good![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Now c’mon, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s\r\nhave\r\nus\r\na\r\nfruitful\r\nbattle![VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s an L for me! Man, you’ve gotten so good![VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s a W for me! You battled real well, though![VAR 0114(0004)]
I think that should be enough of a warm-up![VAR 0114(0004)]
You and your Pokémon should be all set now.\nHere—take these as thanks for the battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
There’s just two Gyms remaining. Then all that’ll\nbe left is to try out to be a Champion! Give it all\r\nyou got![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now let’s get you back to the Gym lobby![VAR 0114(0004)]

Rika! Rika![VAR 0114(002C)]
Huh? Oh, right... You two haven’t met, have you?[VAR 0114(0013)]
This young man is [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0013)]
This young lady is [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0013)]

Oh wow... Oh wow![VAR 0114(002C)]
B-but I think the Pokémon on Team Poppy are\nreally strong, too.\c\nLike, REALLY strong![VAR 0114(0014)]
Which one of you is stronger, do you think?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Well, ummm...[VAR 0114(0014)]
I’m one of the Elite Four! So I’m more amazing![VAR 0114(0014)]
Ahahahahaha! Now aren’t you just adorable![VAR 0114(0013)]
I know it’s hard to believe, but this tiny little one\nis indeed one of the Elite Four.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Yeah! I am![VAR 0114(0014)]
I hope I get to show you my Pokémon\nsoon, mister![VAR 0114(0014)]
I hope I get to show you my Pokémon soon, miss![VAR 0114(0014)]
So hurry up and come to the Pokémon League!\nIt’s where the, um...pinnacle! It’s where the\r\npinnacle of Pokémon battling happens!\r\nSee you there![VAR 0114(0014)]
Hey, wait up![VAR 0114(0013)]
Well, you keep up the good work! You heard the\nkid—she’s waiting for you![VAR 0114(0013)]

But I’m zero percent worried about you. I know\nyou got this![VAR 0114(0004)]
Even La Primera seems like she wants to keep\nan eye on you...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Maybe I’ll go find her so we can cheer you on\ntogether when you battle the Gym Leader![VAR 0114(0004)]
So go have a battle that’s fruitful for you AND\nfor the crowd![VAR 0114(0004)]

I know I said I wasn’t worried, but my heart was\nstill pounding the whole time![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Most impressive, [VAR 0100(0000)]. A\nshining\r\ndisplay\r\nof\r\ntalent,\r\nI must\r\nadmit.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Seriously. Pat yourself on the back—you beat\nevery single Gym![VAR 0114(0004)]
Which means...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Indeed.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Now that you’ve gathered eight Gym Badges...[VAR 0114(0011)]
all that’s left is to take on the Pokémon League![VAR 0114(0011)]
If you hope to stand alongside Nemona as a\nfellow Champion...[VAR 0114(0011)]
head to the Pokémon League. That is where you\ncan take on the Champion Assessment.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Yeah—hurry up and get to my rank! I’m itching\nfor a battle of equals![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ve gotta take the time while you’re facing the\nPokémon League to fine-tune my Pokémon’s\r\nmoves and revamp all my tactics![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Well, good luck, [VAR 0100(0000)]! And\nwish\r\nme\r\nluck, too![VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s unusual for me to see her so excited—\nthough perhaps not for you.[VAR 0114(0011)]
She must really be happy that she finally has a\nfriend who can keep pace with her own talents.[VAR 0114(0011)]
There’s a special kind of strength that can only\nbe reached by competing with a good rival.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Count me among those eager to see how far\nyou two can go![VAR 0114(0011)]
In any case, I’ll be waiting for you at the\nPokémon League, northwest of Mesagoza.[VAR 0114(0011)]

What are you doing? Please take your seat.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Thank you for coming today.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Please, do have a seat.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I, Rika, will be your interviewer.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Let’s get started with the first portion of the\nChampion Assessment.[VAR 0114(0013)]
We begin with the interview.[VAR 0114(0013)]
First things first—let me see how many Gym\nBadges you have...\c\nExcellent! You have all eight![VAR 0114(0013)]
Next, I’d like to ask you a few questions, if you\nwouldn’t mind, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0013)]
Please think carefully, as you may automatically\nfail the interview depending on your answers.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Let’s begin.[VAR 0114(0013)]
How did you get here today?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I walked
I rode on my Pokémon
I came by Flying Taxi
Very good, very good.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Please tell me the name of the school you are\nenrolled in.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Manzana Academy
Naranja Academy
Uva Academy
Ah, that’s right.[VAR 0114(0013)]
So, what brings you to the Pokémon League\ntoday?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I came to catch Pokémon
I came to become a Champion
Just for fun, I guess...
Yes, indeed. Why else would you be here,\nI suppose.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, what do you intend to do if and when you\nbecome a Champion?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I want to become even stronger
I want to battle Nemona
I want to find treasure
I see. Interesting.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Tell me: Which of the eight Gyms gave you the\nmost difficulty?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Cortondo Gym
Artazon Gym
Cascarrafa Gym
Levincia Gym
Medali Gym
Glaseado Gym
Montenevera Gym
Alfornada Gym
I see.[VAR 0114(0013)]
And what was the name of the Gym Leader you\nfaced there?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Larry
Katy
Brassius
Grusha
Iono
Kofu
Ryme
Tulip
I’m glad you seem to remember.[VAR 0114(0013)]
But do you remember which type of Pokémon\n[VAR 0100(0001)] used?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Water
Grass
Electric
Ice
Bug
Ghost
Psychic
Normal
Wonderful.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Building the skills needed for the Champion\nAssessment is no small feat.[VAR 0114(0013)]
You must have met a lot of Pokémon to get\nhere, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0013)]
What was the category of the Pokémon you\nchose to be your first partner?[VAR 0114(0013)]
The Grass Cat Pokémon
The Fire Croc Pokémon
The Duckling Pokémon
Very good, very good.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, please forgive me, but I’m going to repeat\na previous question.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Remind me, what do you intend to do if\nand when you become a Champion?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I want to become even stronger
I want to battle Nemona
I want to find treasure
Ah, yes, that’s right.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Next is the final question for this interview.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Do you like Pokémon, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0013)]
... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0013)]
I see...[VAR 0114(0013)]
That concludes this interview.[VAR 0114(0013)]
One of the staff will let you know the results.\nThank you again for your time.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, please excuse me.[VAR 0114(0013)]
How’d that happen...?[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Sorry to keep you waiting,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].
Now, regarding the results of the interview\nportion of your Champion Assessment...
I’m sorry to say you didn’t pass.
Just between you and me, I’ve heard they won’t\ninterview you seriously until you have all eight\r\nGym Badges.
You can take the Champion Assessment as many\ntimes as you want.
I hope you come back for another try soon!
Thank you very much for your time today.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Please, do have a seat.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I, Rika, will be your interviewer.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, let’s get started with the first portion of\nthe Champion Assessment.[VAR 0114(0013)]
As I mentioned, this portion will take the form of\nan interview.[VAR 0114(0013)]
First things first, let me see how many Gym\nBadges you have...\c\nI see... So you have [VAR 0200(0001)] badges.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, I’d like to ask you a few questions, if you\nwouldn’t mind, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0013)]
Please think carefully, as you may be disqualified\nimmediately depending on your answers.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Let’s begin.[VAR 0114(0013)]
How did you get here today?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I walked
I rode on my Pokémon
I came by Flying Taxi
Uh huh...[VAR 0114(0013)]
What type was the very first Pokémon you chose?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Grass
Fire
Water
I take it you like the [VAR 0103(0001)] type, then.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Next, please tell me why you want to become\na Champion.[VAR 0114(0013)]
I want to test my skills
I want to become stronger
I was invited by a friend
Each person has a different reason, of course.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, please tell me... Is there anything that’s\nvery popular at your school?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Pokémon battles
Studying
The Treasure Hunt
I see. I’m glad it’s something wholesome.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Next is the final question from me.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Do you have any comments or questions\nabout the Pokémon League or the Gyms?[VAR 0114(0013)]
This interview is pretty tough...
The Gym Tests are a lot of fun!
The Gym Leaders are all really strong
Nothing in particular
You might feel differently if you gather all eight\nGym Badges...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Each Gym Leader is responsible for coming up\nwith their own Gym’s test.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh, of course. They’re the ideal Gym Leaders,\nhandpicked by La Primera herself.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh, is that so? Very well...[VAR 0114(0013)]
That concludes this interview.[VAR 0114(0013)]
One of the staff will let you know the results.\nThank you again for your time.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Now, please excuse me.[VAR 0114(0013)]

Good job, kiddo.[VAR 0114(0013)]
That about wraps up the interview.[VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]And let me be the first to congratulate you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0013)]
You just passed the first part of the Champion\nAssessment![VAR 0114(0013)]
On your first try too, no less! Don’t think\nanyone’s done that since Nemona.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Honestly I don’t know why you bungled it\nbefore...[VAR 0114(0013)]
But anyway, time to switch gears and get ready\nfor the next segment.[VAR 0114(0013)]
The second segment is what we call the Elite Test.[VAR 0114(0013)]
And you’ll be facing the Elite Four in Pokémon\nbattles![VAR 0114(0013)]
...I guess that’s pretty obvious from the name of\nthe test, huh.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Anyway, we’re the best the League has to offer.\nYou’ll be facing us four in a row—no turning back.[VAR 0114(0013)]
This won’t be a cakewalk—I promise you that.\nMake sure you’re all ready, then go into the\r\nroom behind me.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Once you’re ready for the Elite Test, go into\nthe room behind me.[VAR 0114(0013)]
There’s no turning back now!

You can’t go any farther until you win!
[~ 2]
Now then, let’s get this started, eh?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Let good ol’ Rika be the first of the Elite Four\nto take you on![VAR 0114(0013)]
I’d say I’ll go easy on you, but...I’d be lying!\nThink fast![VAR 0114(0013)]
Talk about unfair. No way was I ever gonna win\nthat one.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Still, though, what a great battle. Felt good even\nto lose![VAR 0114(0013)]
Not a whole lot of Trainers have the skill to make\nit past the Elite Test...\c\nBut who knows?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I’m beginning to think you might be one of the\nfew that do, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0013)]
Better stay on your toes, though—the second of\nthe Elite Four is stronger than me![VAR 0114(0013)]
You’re up next, squirt! Come on out![VAR 0114(0013)]
Cooomiiing![VAR 0114(0014)]
Oh wow! Did you lose, Rika?[VAR 0114(0014)]
Yeah, I did... [VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s no pushover, let me tell you![VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ll be watching from the side. Avenge me if you\ncan, eh?[VAR 0114(0013)]
You bet I will![VAR 0114(0014)]
I’ll be watching to see just how far you make\nit, kiddo.[VAR 0114(0013)]

Are you ready to face Poppy of the Elite Four?
It’s so cool you made it this far! But this is where\nyou say bye-bye, mister![VAR 0114(0014)]
It’s so cool you made it this far! But this is where\nyou say bye-bye, miss![VAR 0114(0014)]
All my Pokémon are super tough![VAR 0114(0014)]
Your weak attacks won’t work on them at all!\nThey’ll bounce right off—you’ll see![VAR 0114(0014)]
I can’t wait for you to meet my friends, so...\nhere they come![VAR 0114(0014)]
Waaaaaah! Waaaaaah! I wanted to take revenge\non you, Rika![VAR 0114(0014)]
Pretty sure you mean “take revenge FOR” me,\nsquirt. Don’t think I did anything wrong by you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Hate to say it, but you lost, Poppy. Better call the\nnext guy![VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh, that’s right! I haven’t had to do this in a\nlong time![VAR 0114(0014)]
It’s your turn, Mr. Larry![VAR 0114(0014)]
Hello there... It’s me, Larry.[VAR 0114(0015)]
That’s two of the Elite Four down—but you’ve\ngot another two to go, so hang in there![VAR 0114(0013)]
Mr. Larry’s real strong, y’know! Like, reeeal\nstrong![VAR 0114(0014)]

Are you ready to face Larry of the Elite Four?
So, you made it this far.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I serve as a member of the Elite Four too, yes...\nUnfortunately for me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
At my Gym, I use Normal-type Pokémon, since\nI feel they have a lot in common with me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
But, well, the boss told me to use a different\ntype here.[VAR 0114(0015)]
So if you have any complaints, please take them\nup with La Primera.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Anyway, time to get to work.[VAR 0114(0015)]
You’re a lot stronger than I recall. No wonder\nLa Primera likes you.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Now then... I suppose the final member of the\nElite Four is next.[VAR 0114(0015)]
It’s your turn, Hassel...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Now, where could he be?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Uh... Don’t think he heard you, Larry.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Come on in, Hassel...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Larry, you...you may need to speak up just a\nlittle bit more.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Hassel...?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Haaasselll! You’re up next![VAR 0114(0013)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hello there, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nIt delights\r\nme\r\nto\r\nsee\r\nyou here.[VAR 0114(0012)]
As for you, Larry... I see you made Rika do the\nshouting again, hm?[VAR 0114(0012)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Hassel’s the Elite Four’s last line of defense.\nI can’t wait to see how you’ll take him on![VAR 0114(0013)]
It’s super amazing you defeated Mr. Larry![VAR 0114(0014)]
...I get the feeling I’m in for another one of\nHassel’s endless lectures.[VAR 0114(0015)]

Are you ready to face Hassel of the Elite Four?
I was, of course, absolutely certain you would\nmake it to me eventually.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Young sprouts truly do grow with astounding\nspeed, yes...[VAR 0114(0012)]
But I never for a moment imagined we would be\nfacing each other so soon![VAR 0114(0012)]
Now, a teacher’s duty is to guide students and\naid their growth.[VAR 0114(0012)]
But I think I shall forget about my role as a\nteacher for a moment...[VAR 0114(0012)]
and wield all my might for the sole purpose of\ndefeating you![VAR 0114(0012)]
I am Hassel, the dragon guarding the final\nfortress of the Elite Test.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Prepare to learn firsthand how the fiery breath\nof ferocious battle feels![VAR 0114(0012)]
Y-you really did it...[VAR 0114(0013)]
Oh wow![VAR 0114(0014)]
Huh.[VAR 0114(0015)]

I’b...I’b just so proud ob you...[VAR 0114(0012)]
BWUUUH huh huh hoi hoi![VAR 0114(0012)]
Awww, don’t cry, Grandpa Hassel! There, there—\nwanna hug?[VAR 0114(0014)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Sorry ’bout all this, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nThe\r\nold\r\nman\r\ncan\r\nget\r\nlike\r\nthat\r\nsometimes.[VAR 0114(0013)]
So whad ib I do?! I’b jusd—jusd so oberwhelmed![VAR 0114(0012)]
Guess I’ve got to do the talking...\c\nAnyway, your result for the Elite Test of the\nChampion Assessment is...[VAR 0114(0013)]
a pass! No doubt about it![VAR 0114(0013)]
Yeeeaaah! You’re tougher than steel![VAR 0114(0014)]
Yep.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Y-you did so BEAUDIFULLY![VAR 0114(0012)]
Congratulations![VAR 0114(0013)]
I’d say you’re good to go, but...there’s actually\njust a wee bit more to the Champion Assessment.[VAR 0114(0013)]
This’ll be your final trial.[VAR 0114(0013)]
See the door back there?[VAR 0114(0013)]
Our fearless commander—the final opponent\nyou’ll face for your test—is waiting beyond it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Her skills are so amazing, she was able to\nstrong-arm all of us into joining the Elite Four.\c\nYou won’t find a mightier Champion.[VAR 0114(0013)]
Though I think you’ll do fine, kiddo! You beat\nme, after all![VAR 0114(0013)]
I’ll patch up your team—on the house—so don’t\nlose, you hear?[VAR 0114(0013)]
I really love your Pokémon, miss![VAR 0114(0014)]
I really love your Pokémon, mister![VAR 0114(0014)]
So I’ll cheer for you as hard as I can![VAR 0114(0014)]
Well, uh, good lu—[VAR 0114(0015)]
Even a baby dragon can breathe fire![VAR 0114(0012)]
Whoa! Guess you got over your sobs, huh?[VAR 0114(0013)]
You can do this. We all know you can.[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Now go, young [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYour\r\nhands\r\nmay\r\nbe\r\nsmall,\r\nbut\r\nlet\r\nthem\r\nseize\r\na\r\ngreat victory![VAR 0114(0012)]

Are you ready to face the final test of the\nChampion Assessment?
Welcome, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
It gives me great joy that you’ve managed to\nmake it all the way to the pinnacle of the\r\nPokémon League.[VAR 0114(0011)]
The final test is a battle against me, the Top\nChampion.\c\nTo pass, all you need to do...is win.[VAR 0114(0011)]
But before we get started, I should apologize\nfor one thing.[VAR 0114(0011)]
You see, I have a trait that some might say is\ninappropriate for the League Chairwoman...[VAR 0114(0011)]
I am utterly incapable of holding back when it\ncomes to Pokémon battles.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Maybe that’s why nobody’s passed this test\nrecently. It’s a bit of a problem, to be honest.[VAR 0114(0011)]
But you... You might manage something\nwonderful, like Champion Nemona did.[VAR 0114(0011)]
So, are you ready for your final test?[VAR 0114(0011)]
I want to see the true measure of your talent![VAR 0114(0011)]
Such overwhelming power... Such amazing skill...[VAR 0114(0011)]
It seems Paldea has gained another wonderful\nTrainer to be proud of.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Congratulations. It’s my honor to call you\nChampion [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
“Congratulations” is right! Now I can really say\nyou’re good to go![VAR 0114(0013)]
Yaaay! You did it, mister![VAR 0114(0014)]
Yaaay! You did it, miss![VAR 0114(0014)]
Congratulations.[VAR 0114(0015)]
J-j-just ABAAAZIIING! I gan’t...I GAN’T HOLD\nID IN ANYBOOORE![VAR 0114(0012)]
Oof, crying again?[VAR 0114(0013)]
You Pokémon Trainers are the treasure of Paldea.[VAR 0114(0011)]
And amid that treasure, Champions are the\njewels that shine brightest.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0011)]
It is now your duty to set an example for all of\nthe Trainers of Paldea.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Now, allow me to walk you back to the entrance.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I’m certain you’ll find a familiar face\nawaiting you.[VAR 0114(0011)]

Oh man, I can tell just looking at you! You did it,\nright? You became a Champion?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Ha, you’ve got jokes! But seriously—you did\nbecome a Champion, right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
C’mon, it’s me! You don’t have to lie! Just tell\nme—you became a Champion, right?![VAR 0114(0004)]
OK, wait! You DID become a Champion, though,\ndidn’t you?![VAR 0114(0004)]
You! Champion! Yes?![VAR 0114(0004)]
Ha haaa! I knew all along![VAR 0114(0004)]
I got word from La Primera when you cleared the\nElite Test![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh man, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI’m a\r\nChampion,\r\nand\r\nnow,\r\nyou’re\r\na Champion![VAR 0114(0004)]
Which means we’re true equals! You and me,\nboth Champion-ranked Trainers! This is amazing![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now that you’ve made it here, I’ve got one thing\nto say.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Let’s you and me be best rivals for life![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oops! Couldn’t hear you! I’ll say it again: let’s\nyou and me be best rivals for life![VAR 0114(0004)]
Sorry, not going to stop until I hear a yes—\nlet’s you and me be best rivals for life![VAR 0114(0004)]
OK, wait! You WILL be my rival, won’t you?![VAR 0114(0004)]
You! Me! Rivals! Yes?![VAR 0114(0004)]
YESSS! Toma ya![VAR 0114(0004)]

I’m gonna hit you with EVERYTHING this time!\nYou ready?![VAR 0114(0004)]
Do wait a moment, Champion Nemona.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Huh? What’s the matter, Primera?[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]The Champion Assessment has only just ended.\nI believe a rest is in order for Champion\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\n[VAR 0101(0001)],\r\nand\r\nthe others.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]The Champion Assessment has only just ended.\nI believe a rest is in order for Champion\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nand [VAR 0101(0001)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
Champions must be understanding toward\ntheir opponents.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Urk. Right...[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]There I go getting overexcited again! Sorry,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nand\r\n[VAR 0101(0001)].[VAR 0114(0004)]
I also must ask—is this roadside really the setting\nyou two want for your first battle as true equals\r\nand rivals?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Hmm... Now that you mention it, that’s a\ngood point.[VAR 0114(0004)]
In that case, can we use one of the Pokémon\nLeague battle courts?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Surely there’s somewhere more fitting. A place\nwith special meaning for the two of you, perhaps.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Special meaning, huh? Hmm... Let me see...\nAnywhere leap to mind, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Out behind your house
Mesagoza
The Treasure Eatery
Haha! Our beach out back, huh? Yeah, the place\nwhere we had our first battle might work.[VAR 0114(0004)]
But on the other hand, to me it’s just kind of...\nmy backyard, y’know? A little ordinary.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyplace else come to mind?[VAR 0114(0004)]
The Treasure Eatery? Is it significant to the two of\nyou somehow?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Ah, are you thinking of it ’cause it’s got the\nMedali Gym’s battle court?\c\nI guess it does bring back memories...of Larry...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Larry may not appreciate the surprise visit.\c\nIf you’ve any other suitable places in mind, would\nyou prioritize them instead, please?[VAR 0114(0011)]
Mesagoza? Oooh, good call! The place where we\nset out on our journey![VAR 0114(0004)]
That reminds me, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nRemember back when Director Clavell explained\nthe [VAR FF00(0006)]Treasure Hunt[VAR FF00(0000)]? Y’know how he told us to go\r\nin search of our own treasure?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, I know what treasure I got out of all this:\nI found a true rival—someone who can stand up\r\nto me at my full capabilities.[VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s right—I mean you! I’m so glad I got to\nmeet you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyway, that being said...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ll be waiting for you at the battle court in\nMesagoza’s central plaza! See ya there![VAR 0114(0004)]
The respect you two share is palpable. Even a bit\nenviable, to be honest.[VAR 0114(0011)]
I am known as La Primera—but even when facing\nme in the final test of her Champion Assessment,\r\nChampion Nemona didn’t reveal her full might.[VAR 0114(0011)]
In you, I suspect she has found someone she can\nbattle without holding anything back.[VAR 0114(0011)]

Hello, hello. My name’s Jacq, and I’ll be your\nPokémon biology teacher.[VAR 0114(002A)]
In my class, we’ll all learn about the various\nquirks of our beloved Pokémon together![VAR 0114(002A)]
I hope you all come to love Pokémon even more\nfrom the things you learn here.[VAR 0114(002A)]
In today’s class, I’ll teach you a great way to\nget to know Pokémon in more depth.[VAR 0114(002A)]
If you’d like to become better friends with your\nPokémon...[VAR 0114(002A)]
you can let them come out of their Poké Ball\nand walk along with you! Sounds great, huh?[VAR 0114(002A)]
You can use the [VAR FF00(0006)]ZR Button[VAR FF00(0000)] to throw a Poké Ball\nand let out the Pokémon inside.\c\nNothing cuter than watching your Pokémon run\naround underfoot, if you ask me.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Once you let your Pokémon out, try speaking to\nthem—they’re sure to respond in some way.\r\nIt’s a great way to get to know them better![VAR 0114(002A)]
However! Letting your Pokémon out of its ball\nisn’t such a great idea in some locations.\c\nCan anyone tell me where it is that you shouldn’t\nhave your Pokémon walk along with you?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Near the water
Inside buildings
In tall grass
It’s certainly true that some Pokémon aren’t fond\nof water, but we do have floating platforms they\r\ncan use, so being near water isn’t an issue.[VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That’s right! Great job, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI see\r\nyou\r\ndid\r\nyour\r\nhomework.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Pokémon love tall grass! I can’t see them having\nany problem walking with you there.[VAR 0114(002A)]
The correct answer is that we should not walk\nwith our Pokémon indoors. How about that![VAR 0114(002A)]
Some Pokémon might damage walls, desks, and\nother things walking around inside buildings, so\r\nit’s not allowed regardless of the species.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Therefore, please only let your Pokémon out of\ntheir Poké Balls while outdoors. OK, everyone?\c\nI think I see them out and about in classrooms\nfrom time to time, but still...[VAR 0114(002A)]
Anyway, you may become even closer friends\nwith your Pokémon pals by walking together![VAR 0114(002A)]
Oh! I almost forgot—keep in mind that you can\nonly walk together with your lead Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Remember—use the [VAR FF00(0006)]ZR Button[VAR FF00(0000)] to throw a ball\nand let out the Pokémon inside.\c\nYou’ll also want to remember that throwing a\nball at a wild Pokémon will start a battle![VAR 0114(002A)]
It looks like that’s all the time we have for today.\nSee you all next class![VAR 0114(002A)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : class_a_02.dat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hello, hello. I hope everyone’s ready to learn\nsome new things today![VAR 0114(002A)]
Did you all try using the ZR Button to let your\nPokémon out as I taught you in our last class?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Walking along with your Pokémon lets you see\nhow unique and cute they all are.[VAR 0114(002A)]
I’d also highly recommend picnics for when you\nwant to spend some quality time together with\r\nthe Pokémon in your party.[VAR 0114(002A)]
You can get them all around the table to make\nsandwiches and play—it’s really a lot of fun![VAR 0114(002A)]
If you want to learn more about making food,\nMr. Saguaro’s class is the best place to go![VAR 0114(002A)]
Now, sometimes, while you’re enjoying a picnic\nwith your Pokémon...[VAR 0114(002A)]
you may find something very, VERY important in\nthe basket next to your table![VAR 0114(002A)]
This very important something is what Pokémon\nare born from. Let’s all say it together![VAR 0114(002A)]
Boxes!
Poké Balls!
Eggs!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? Um...[VAR 0100(0000)], it looks\nlike\r\nyou’re\r\nthe\r\nonly\r\none\r\nwho\r\nsaid Boxes.\c\nWe sometimes send Pokémon to Boxes for\nsafekeeping, but they’re not born from them![VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? Um...[VAR 0100(0000)], it looks\nlike\r\nyou’re\r\nthe\r\nonly\r\none\r\nwho\r\nsaid\r\nPoké Balls!\c\nI don’t believe there have been any Pokémon\ndiscovered yet that are born from Poké Balls![VAR 0114(002A)]
Phew! You all got it right![VAR 0114(002A)]
The very important something I’m talking about\nis...a Pokémon Egg![VAR 0114(002A)]
It’s not clear where these Eggs come from, but\nthey’re probably placed in the basket rather\r\nstealthily by the Pokémon at the picnic.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Walking around with an Egg will help warm it,\nwhich allows it to hatch.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Eggs won’t warm up by sitting in Boxes, though.\nYou need to have them in your party![VAR 0114(002A)]
And here’s one more super important thing I’d\nlike you to remember about Eggs.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Pokémon entrust us with their Eggs because they\nbelieve in us![VAR 0114(002A)]
So, I sure would be happy to see you all being\nresponsible parents for your little Pokémon Eggs![VAR 0114(002A)]
Whoops. My most important point came right as\nthe bell rang. Well, see you all next time, I guess![VAR 0114(002A)]

Hello, hello. I hope everyone’s ready to learn\nsome new things today![VAR 0114(002A)]
I seem to remember teaching you all about the\nimportance of Eggs in our last class together.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Ah, on that note, is everyone using their\nPokédex?[VAR 0114(002A)]
It registers Pokémon born from Eggs as well as\nthose encountered via other methods, so don’t\r\nyou worry about that![VAR 0114(002A)]
And, uh, hehe...just so you know, I’m the one who\ndeveloped the Pokédex app![VAR 0114(002A)]
It was waaay before I started teaching here at the\nacademy, though.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Back then, I was a researcher.[VAR 0114(002A)]
In fact, Director Clavell wasn’t working in\neducation at the time, either!\c\nHe was researching alongside me at the\nsame facility.[VAR 0114(002A)]
We got to research Pokémon together day in,\nday out... Those sure were fun times.\c\nI got yelled at all the time, though. Heh.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Wait a second, how did I get onto this?\nPretty sure I was talking about the Pokédex...[VAR 0114(002A)]
Uh... Anyway! Today, I’d like to teach you about\ncatching Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
As you all know, a great way to catch a Pokémon\nmore easily is to first lower its HP.[VAR 0114(002A)]
But there’s another way to up your chances of a\nsuccessful catch. Can you guess what it is?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Give the Pokémon a Berry
Inflict the Pokémon with a status condition
Prove you’re stronger than the Pokémon
Huh? Hmmm... Maybe that’s a bit of advice from\nanother region?\c\nThe common understanding here in Paldea may\nbe a little different.[VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Wow! That’s right, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nGreat job![VAR 0114(002A)]
That’s a rough-and-tumble way to look at things,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nI guess it’s true that sending out a strong\nPokémon can turn a battle in your favor, though.[VAR 0114(002A)]
The correct technique for making Pokémon easier\nto catch is to inflict them with a status condition.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Sleep is an especially effective status condition.\nIt makes Pokémon drastically easier to catch![VAR 0114(002A)]
If you have a Pokémon that can use moves that\nput opponents to sleep, like Sleep Powder or\r\nHypnosis, filling up your Pokédex will be a cinch![VAR 0114(002A)]
There are other ways to improve your catch rate\nas well, like using Poké Balls specifically designed\r\nto be effective against certain Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Eating food that gives you Catching Power works,\ntoo—or sneaking up on Pokémon from behind to\r\ncatch them by surprise when you start a battle![VAR 0114(002A)]
If you’re having trouble, you may want to make\nthe rounds to the Gyms to get Gym Badges.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Earning Gym Badges will make it easier to catch\nPokémon of higher and higher levels![VAR 0114(002A)]
Please do come show me your Pokédexes once\nthey start to fill up![VAR 0114(002A)]
Another day, another enjoyable class. Oh yeah,\ndon’t forget—our next class will be a test![VAR 0114(002A)]

—This question won’t affect your grade!—\n\nHow do you like the Pokédex? Is it easy to use?\nI’d be happy to hear your honest opinions!
It’s easy to use!
It’s all right
I don’t use it that much...
All right, everyone! Time’s up! I hope you all\nenjoyed tackling those questions![VAR 0114(002A)]
That last question was just something that I’m\npersonally curious to know.\c\nDon’t tell the director about it, OK?[VAR 0114(002A)]
I’ll grade these right away. I hope you’re all\nlooking forward to seeing how you did![VAR 0114(002A)]

Hello, hello. I hope everyone’s ready to learn\nsome new things today![VAR 0114(002A)]
You all did really great on the midterm exam![VAR 0114(002A)]
Thanks for answering my little question at the\nend, too.\c\nI’ll be sure to keep your responses in mind.[VAR 0114(002A)]
All right! We’re now heading into the last half\nof our classes together.[VAR 0114(002A)]
It’s time for our knowledge to evolve and grow—\njust like our Pokémon![VAR 0114(002A)]
Evolution...yep. Haha! Evolution![VAR 0114(002A)]
Today we’re going to learn about the fascinating\nphenomenon of Pokémon Evolution![VAR 0114(002A)]
As your Pokémon battle and level up, they learn\nmoves and get stronger.[VAR 0114(002A)]
And for some Pokémon, once they’ve leveled up\nenough...[VAR 0114(002A)]
their appearance changes, and their stats\nincrease—sometimes by a lot![VAR 0114(002A)]
That’s Pokémon Evolution![VAR 0114(002A)]
Pokémon become very strong when they evolve,\nmaking them trusty partners in battle.[VAR 0114(002A)]
But! Some people prefer to keep their Pokémon\nin their adorable pre-evolved states.[VAR 0114(002A)]
To do this, you just need to remember a certain\nbutton when your Pokémon begins to evolve.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Say it with me if you already know! To cancel\nEvolution, press the...[VAR 0114(002A)]
A Button!
B Button!
C Button!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? Um...[VAR 0100(0000)], you may\nbe\r\nthinking\r\nof\r\nsomething else.\c\nThe A Button has more of a decisive feel to it.\nKinda like “A-OK!” don’t you think?[VAR 0114(002A)]
That’s right, everyone! “B” for “best answer!”[VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? Um...[VAR 0100(0000)], you may\nbe\r\nthinking\r\nof\r\nsomething else.\c\nThe C Button... That has a bit of a nostalgic feel\nto it, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(002A)]
The button you want when you need to stop a\nPokémon from evolving is the B Button![VAR 0114(002A)]
If you press this button soon after a Pokémon\nbegins to evolve, you can stop it from changing.[VAR 0114(002A)]
You can also let the Pokémon hold an item known\nas an Everstone to keep it from evolving.[VAR 0114(002A)]
And keep in mind that the requirements for\nEvolution differ from Pokémon to Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Some may evolve by having a certain item, such\nas a Fire Stone or Thunder Stone, used on them.\c\nOthers may have to learn a specific move or\ndefeat a specific Pokémon in battle to evolve.[VAR 0114(002A)]
The way Primeape evolves into Annihilape is\nespecially strange.[VAR 0114(002A)]
You see, there’s a certain move that—[VAR 0114(002A)]
Whoops. Sorry, looks like we’re out of time![VAR 0114(002A)]
I guess we’ll have to end the class there today.\nThank you all for your attention![VAR 0114(002A)]

Hello, hello. I hope everyone’s ready to learn\nsome new things today![VAR 0114(002A)]
But before we get going, do you all remember\nthe final question from our midterm exam?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Well, Director Clavell found out about it\nsomehow, and I got yelled at. Whoops.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Apparently he could tell I was hiding something\njust by looking at me.[VAR 0114(002A)]
He must’ve noticed all the color flush right out of\nmy face! Haha![VAR 0114(002A)]
Speaking of color, today I’d like to teach you\nall about colors as they pertain to Pokémon![VAR 0114(002A)]
Some Pokémon have slightly different coloration\nor patterning on their bodies based on their\r\ngender or individual differences.[VAR 0114(002A)]
In very rare cases, a Pokémon may have wildly\ndifferent coloration compared to others of the\r\nsame species.[VAR 0114(002A)]
We call these specimens [VAR FF00(0006)]Shiny [VAR FF00(0000)]Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
It is quite rare to cross paths with one.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Does anyone here know what the likelihood of\nfinding a Shiny Pokémon is?[VAR 0114(002A)]
1 in 40
1 in 400
1 in 4,000
It would be nice if they were that common! We\nwould be able to do far more research on them.\r\nBut they’re actually quite a bit more rare.[VAR 0114(002A)]
That’s not a bad guess. But they’re actually\neven rarer than 1 in 400![VAR 0114(002A)]
Wow! That’s right! You may have the makings of a\nPokémon Professor, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(002A)]
Shiny Pokémon appear at a rate of 1 in 4,000.\nIsn’t that amazing?[VAR 0114(002A)]
The probability of encountering one in the wild is\nthe same as hatching one from an Egg, too![VAR 0114(002A)]
Eggs from a pair of Pokémon raised around\ndiffering languages are a special case.[VAR 0114(002A)]
There is a higher than average chance that\na Shiny Pokémon will hatch from these Eggs.[VAR 0114(002A)]
But we haven’t been able to figure out why that is\njust yet.[VAR 0114(002A)]
I’ve also heard rumors of a charm that increases\nyour likelihood of finding Shiny Pokémon when\r\nyou have it in your Bag—can you believe that?![VAR 0114(002A)]
This claim can’t be scientifically verified, but it\nsure would be fun if it were true.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Whoops...there’s the bell.[VAR 0114(002A)]
That’s all for today. Thank you for your attention![VAR 0114(002A)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : class_a_07.dat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hello, hello. I hope everyone’s ready to learn\nsome new things today![VAR 0114(002A)]
Next time we meet, we’ll have our final exam.\nThat means today is our last actual class.[VAR 0114(002A)]
And the topic for this last class will be...Pokémon\n[VAR FF00(0006)]forms[VAR FF00(0000)]! You can just think of forms as the shapes\r\nor appearances that Pokémon have.[VAR 0114(002A)]
There’s also a phenomenon called a [VAR FF00(0006)]form[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]change[VAR FF00(0000)], where a Pokémon’s appearance\r\nchanges under certain conditions.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Cyclizar, for example, which we regularly ride on\nas transportation here in Paldea, has three forms.[VAR 0114(002A)]
First is its basic form, where it walks on four\nlegs. Second is its battle form, where it stands\r\non its hind legs to engage in battle.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Finally, there’s its ride form, where it inflates its\nthroat sac and its tail so we can ride on its back.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Though we can use something you’re all carrying\nwith you now as an even better example![VAR 0114(002A)]
Yup, I’m talking about your phones! Some\nsmartphones are inhabited by a certain Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Does anyone know the Pokémon I’m referring to?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Rotom
Pikachu
Heracross
You’re a regular expert on Pokémon AND\ntechnology, aren’t you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(002A)]
It sure would be adorable if it were Pikachu in\nour phones—and it would probably make us want\r\nto walk around more, too!\c\nBut too bad, that’s not the right answer![VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Haha! I see where you’re coming from,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nHeracross can learn a move called Smart Strike!\nSmartphone, Smart Strike... Well, unfortunately,\r\nthere’s no connection![VAR 0114(002A)]
The Pokémon inside your smartphone is Rotom,\nand it does all sorts of things to help you out.[VAR 0114(002A)]
A Rotom inside a Rotom Phone is special, so it\ndoesn’t try to enter other electronics.[VAR 0114(002A)]
An ordinary Rotom, however, can change form by\nentering washing machines, microwave ovens,\r\nand other electronic appliances.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Rotom is a bit of an exception, though. Many\nPokémon that change form do so simply by\r\nholding an item or by having one used on them.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Oricorio, for example, has four different forms it\ncan change between when given certain nectars.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Pokémon may even change type or learn\ndifferent moves when they change form.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Form changes are different from Evolution in that\nthe Pokémon can return to its original form.\c\nAnd unlike Shiny Pokémon, which can’t change\ntheir special coloration, the same individual\r\nPokémon can go back and forth between\r\nits forms.[VAR 0114(002A)]
There’s a lot to dig into with this form change\nphenomenon, as you can see![VAR 0114(002A)]
We can all learn something from Pokémon\nhere, don’t you think? Bit of a stretch, but...[VAR 0114(002A)]
I’d be happy to see you all enjoy your time at\nthe academy to the fullest...and change form\r\ninto a new version of yourselves![VAR 0114(002A)]
Or something like that, anyway![VAR 0114(002A)]
Oh! I almost forgot![VAR 0114(002A)]
Regional forms, which vary based on what region\na Pokémon came from, don’t change like other\r\nforms. They’re an innate—[VAR 0114(002A)]
Whoops. Heh...there’s the bell.[VAR 0114(002A)]
I guess I was scatterbrained Mr. Jacq right up to\nthe very end, huh?\c\nI had a great time teaching all of you. I hope\nyou’ll do your best on the final exam![VAR 0114(002A)]

It will cover everything I’ve taught you so far! But\nI’m sure you all will do just fine.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Take your time, and contemplate each question\ncarefully.[VAR 0114(002A)]

True
False
3. If a Pokémon is holding an Everstone, will\n    using an item that induces Evolution, such as\n    a Fire Stone, cause it to evolve?\n\nA) Yes, it will\nB) No, it won’t
A) Yes, it will
B) No, it won’t
4. What is the probability of running into a\n    Shiny Pokémon?\n\nA) 1 in 2,000\nB) 1 in 4,000\nC) 1 in 6,000

—This question won’t affect your grade!—\n\nDo you have anything you would like to say\nabout my class? I’m still getting used to this\nteaching thing, but I sure had fun as your teacher!
It was fun!
Thank you for being our teacher!
Keep teaching! You can do it!
OK! Time’s up whether you like it or not! I hope\neveryone enjoyed tackling those questions![VAR 0114(002A)]
Hehe... I snuck in a little bonus question there\nright at the end again. Shhh, our little secret—\r\ndon’t tell the director![VAR 0114(002A)]
I’ll grade these right away. I hope you’re all\nlooking forward to seeing how you did![VAR 0114(002A)]

Hello, everyone. Nice to meet you. My name’s\nTyme, and I will be your math teacher.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Sorry to put you all on the spot at the start of\nclass, but let me ask you a quick question—\r\nDo you enjoy numbers, arithmetic, and the like?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Yeah!
Sort of.
Errr...
Oh, my. Hahaha. Thank you for your honest\nresponses.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Some of you may like numbers, and some may\nnot. I think that makes a wonderful mix.[VAR 0114(0025)]
But no matter your opinion on math, I hope you\nfind yourselves enjoying our lessons together!\c\nI’ll do my best to find a good way to match up\nyour interests with all types of math lessons![VAR 0114(0025)]
Speaking of which, are you all caught up on your\nstudies of Pokémon type matchups?[VAR 0114(0025)]
For example, Grass is strong against Water, and\nWater is strong against Fire, correct?[VAR 0114(0025)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], you seem to\nbe\r\ngood\r\nwith\r\nPokémon,\r\nso\r\nlet\r\nme\r\nask\r\nyou this...[VAR 0114(0025)]
Bearing in mind that Water is strong against Fire...\nIf the move Water Gun hits a Fire-type Pokémon,\r\nwhat becomes of the move’s damage?[VAR 0114(0025)]
It’s cut in half
It doesn’t change
It’s doubled
Oh, my. A little reverse thinking, I see! But I’d\nprobably be in rough shape afterward if I got hit\r\nby something I was weak to. Wouldn’t you be?[VAR 0114(0025)]
A real hardy individual, I see! But I’d probably\nbe in rough shape afterward if I got hit by\r\nsomething I was weak to. Wouldn’t you be?[VAR 0114(0025)]
That’s right! I knew I could count on you for this\nquestion, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
Using moves of a type that your opponent is\nweak to is a supereffective tactic!\c\nIt multiplies the damage of those moves by two![VAR 0114(0025)]
On the other hand, using moves of a type that\nyour opponent is resistant to isn’t very effective.\r\nIt divides the damage of your moves by two.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Haha! I don’t mean to encroach on Ms. Dendra’s\nbattle studies territory, of course, but I thought\r\nit best to use a lively topic as an example.[VAR 0114(0025)]
That can make math fun even for those of you\nwho don’t much like the subject, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh, my. Is that the bell? I suppose that’s all for\nnow. What a shame...[VAR 0114(0025)]
I’m looking forward to seeing you all in the next\nclass. I hope you’re looking forward to it, too![VAR 0114(0025)]

Hello, everyone. Let’s have a fun class today.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Tell me, do you all enjoy shopping?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Buying tasty bread or choosing new clothes—\neven just window shopping is so much fun![VAR 0114(0025)]
In today’s class, I’d like to use shopping—one of\nmy own favorite hobbies, mind you—to teach\r\nyou all about math![VAR 0114(0025)]
I’m sure everyone here has visited a Poké Mart at\nleast once. They sell all sorts of Pokémon items![VAR 0114(0025)]
Poké Balls are one of the many useful items you\ncan find there. They cost 200 each.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Now then, I’d like you all to do some thinking\nwith me here![VAR 0114(0025)]
One Poké Ball is 200. If you had 2,000 and\nbought as many Poké Balls as you could afford,\r\nhow many would you receive?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Nine
Ten
Eleven
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, my. That guess falls a little short,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0025)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh dear. I’m sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI suppose\r\nthis\r\nwas\r\na bit\r\nof a\r\ntrick question.[VAR 0114(0025)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That’s correct! Well done,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
With 2,000, you can afford to purchase a\nmaximum of 10 Poké Balls...[VAR 0114(0025)]
However! If you purchase 10 or more of any one\ntype of Poké Ball...[VAR 0114(0025)]
You will also receive one Premier Ball—a special\nwhite ball—as a bonus![VAR 0114(0025)]
So the correct answer is, in fact, 11![VAR 0114(0025)]
It sure is nice to get a little bonus like that on a\nshopping trip, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh, my. Is that the bell? I suppose that’s all for\nnow. What a shame...[VAR 0114(0025)]
I’m looking forward to seeing you all in the next\nclass. I hope you’re looking forward to it, too![VAR 0114(0025)]

Hello, everyone. Let’s have a fun class today.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Tell me, do you all enjoy fortune telling,\nhoroscopes, and the like?[VAR 0114(0025)]
I think it feels great to read your horoscope and\nsee that it says good luck is coming your way.[VAR 0114(0025)]
So today, I’d like to teach you all math while\nfocusing on the topic of luck![VAR 0114(0025)]
Perhaps you have seen the following phrase\ncrop up during Pokémon battles before...\c\n“A critical hit!”[VAR 0114(0025)]
When a Pokémon’s attack lands as a critical hit,\nthe damage it deals is increased by half.\c\nIn other words, it does one-and-a-half times as\nmuch damage as it normally would![VAR 0114(0025)]
It is truly luck that determines whether your\nPokémon lands a critical hit—or has one landed\r\non it. This can cause a great upset in battle.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Does anyone know what percent chance a\nPokémon has of landing a critical hit?[VAR 0114(0025)]
About 1 percent (1 in 100 hits)
About 4 percent (4 in 100 hits)
About 12 percent (12 in 100 hits)
Oh, my. Critical hits land a little more often than\nthat, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]That is correct! Well done,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh, my. That might cause a bit TOO critical of a\nsituation, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0025)]
The chance of landing a critical hit is said to be\n1 in 24...which figures to roughly 4.17 percent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
The odds are more favorable for certain moves,\nthough—why, moves such as Stone Edge and\r\nShadow Claw have about a 12 percent chance![VAR 0114(0025)]
You can also use a move called Focus Energy or\nan item known as a Dire Hit.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Both raise the critical-hit ratio by two stages—\nthat’s a 50 percent chance to land a critical hit![VAR 0114(0025)]
It feels great to land a critical hit, but perhaps\nnot so great to be struck by one![VAR 0114(0025)]
There is a surprising amount of mathematical\nprobability hidden in Pokémon battles, you know.[VAR 0114(0025)]
If you’re able to do the calculations that’ll swing\nluck in your favor, it may open the door for more\r\nstrategic choices for you during battle.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh, my. Is that the bell? I suppose that’s all for\nnow. What a shame...[VAR 0114(0025)]
Next class will be our fun midterm exam! I hope\nyou’ll all be looking forward to it.[VAR 0114(0025)]

Text File : class_b_05.dat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hello, everyone. Well done on the midterm exam.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Some of you earned perfect scores, and others\nseemed to have a bit of trouble, but I can tell\r\nthat you all tried your best.[VAR 0114(0025)]
I am quite pleased to say that every last one of\nyou passed.[VAR 0114(0025)]
I can only assume that this means you have all\ncome to love numbers![VAR 0114(0025)]
Stay sharp, and try your best for the rest of my\nclasses, too![VAR 0114(0025)]
Speaking of staying “sharp,” do you know how\nthat word applies to Pokémon battles?\r\nThat’s right—it has to do with stat boosts![VAR 0114(0025)]
A Pokémon’s stats can rise and fall throughout\nthe course of battle, correct?[VAR 0114(0025)]
For example, if a Pokémon uses the move\nWork Up, its Attack and Sp. Atk stats will rise by\r\none stage each.[VAR 0114(0025)]
And, as you may know, each time a Pokémon’s\nAttack or Sp. Atk rises one stage, moves affected\r\nby that stat will deal 50 percent more damage.[VAR 0114(0025)]
If that same Pokémon from our previous example\nwere to use Work Up again, both its Attack and\r\nSp. Atk will have risen by two stages total.\c\nThis results in a 100 percent increase to damage\ndealt, making its moves twice as strong![VAR 0114(0025)]
Swords Dance, on the other hand, boosts Attack\nby two stages at once, allowing the Pokémon to\r\ndeal double damage after just a single use![VAR 0114(0025)]
Using Swords Dance twice would boost the\nPokémon’s Attack stat by four stages. How much\r\nmore damage, then, would this Pokémon deal?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Double damage
Triple damage
Quadruple damage
Ah, yes. This question is a tricky one, isn’t it?\c\nDamage would be doubled if it’d used Work Up\ntwice, but we’re talking about Swords Dance.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Wow, that’s great! You answered this difficult\nquestion with ease, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0025)]
Ah, yes. This question is a tricky one, isn’t it?\c\nJust because it boosts the Pokémon’s stat by four\nstages doesn’t mean damage is quadrupled.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Each stage that a Pokémon’s Attack or Sp. Atk\nstat is raised increases its damage by 50 percent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
So, being raised four stages would result in a four\ntimes 50 percent—or 200 percent—increase.[VAR 0114(0025)]
The base damage of a move is 100 percent, so\nadding 200 percent to that gives us 300 percent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
In other words, the next move the Pokémon uses\nwill deal triple damage.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Type matchups, critical-hit damage, and other\nfactors all play into these calculations as well,\r\nso even a small boost must be taken seriously.[VAR 0114(0025)]
By the way, if a stat simply “rose,” that means it\nhas gone up by one stage.\c\nIf it “rose sharply,” that’s two stages.\c\nAnd if it “rose drastically,” that’s three stages.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Just so you know, the X Attack and X Sp. Atk\nitems, which can only be used in battle, can be\r\nused to sharply boost those respective stats.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh, my. Is that the bell? I suppose that’s all for\nnow. What a shame...[VAR 0114(0025)]
Today’s lesson was a little difficult, so be sure to\nreview what you learned in order to stay “sharp”!\r\nI’ll see you all again next class.[VAR 0114(0025)]

Text File : class_b_06.dat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hello, everyone. Let’s have a fun class today.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Did you make sure to review last class’s material\nin order to stay “sharp”?[VAR 0114(0025)]
I know it was a little difficult with all that talk of\nmultiplication and percentages and the like.[VAR 0114(0025)]
But today, we’ll be talking about percentages\nagain to learn about probability.[VAR 0114(0025)]
That may sound like we’re going to have another\ndifficult class, but did you know that all of you\r\nalready deal with probability on a regular basis?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Pokémon moves generally have a property called\naccuracy, which determines the probability that\r\nthey will hit.[VAR 0114(0025)]
The accuracy of Tackle is 100—or 100 percent.\nSo if you were to use Tackle 100 times, you\r\ncould expect it to hit all 100 times![VAR 0114(0025)]
The move Hypnosis, which puts opponents to\nsleep, has an accuracy of 60—or 60 percent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
That means you could expect it to hit 60 times\nin 100 uses. To put that another way—out of 100\r\nuses, you could expect it to miss 40 times![VAR 0114(0025)]
Many of the truly powerful moves often tend to\nhave lower accuracy.[VAR 0114(0025)]
So when you’re deciding whether to go slow and\nsteady with moves that are sure to hit, or hard\r\nand fast with stronger but less accurate moves...[VAR 0114(0025)]
you’re already studying probability![VAR 0114(0025)]
Let me see here... Perhaps Surf and Hydro Pump\nwould be good examples for this discussion?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Surf has a power of 90. Its accuracy is 100,\nmeaning you can expect it to hit every time.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Hydro Pump’s accuracy is only 80—but when it\nhits, its power is 110![VAR 0114(0025)]
So, between Surf and Hydro Pump, which move\nwould you want to use yourselves?[VAR 0114(0025)]
I’d use Surf
I’d use Hydro Pump
It depends on the situation
Oh my. I see it’s “slow and steady wins the race”\nfor you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh my. I see you like the risky, adventurous side\nof things, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh my. I see you’re always considering various\npossibilities, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
I may have made it sound like there was a correct\nanswer here, but there’s not!\c\nYou’re free to use any moves you wish![VAR 0114(0025)]
Factors like PP or number of targets hit may make\nsome moves more suited to certain situations.\c\nHowever, trading accuracy for power or vice\nversa is purely a matter of preference![VAR 0114(0025)]
This Surf-versus-Hydro Pump debate has been\nongoing for quite some time.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Personally, I’m more invested in debating the\nRock-type moves Rock Slide and Stone Edge.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Let me tell you, I could get really worked up\ntalking about those moves, but—\c\nOh, my. There’s the bell. What a shame.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Next class will be the last of our time together,\nso show up 100 percent ready to go![VAR 0114(0025)]

Text File : class_b_07.dat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hello, everyone. I hope we can have fun once\nagain today for our last class together.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Last time we learned about probability, using\nmove accuracy as an example.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Probability is quite an interesting subject. Did\nyou know that, in a class with 40 students, there\r\nis a 90 percent chance that two of them will have\r\nthe same birthday?[VAR 0114(0025)]
This is true even despite the fact that there are\nover 300 days each year. Isn’t that remarkable?[VAR 0114(0025)]
But let’s move on to today’s topic before we\nget swept along with probability again.[VAR 0114(0025)]
I’ve been teaching you all how to calculate\ndamage in this class using examples like type\r\nmatchups, critical hits, stat boosts, and the like.[VAR 0114(0025)]
All of these variables are multiplied together to\ncalculate damage dealt to an opponent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
However, did you know that there is an even\nsimpler way to increase the damage of your\r\nPokémon’s moves?[VAR 0114(0025)]
All you have to do is have your Pokémon use\na move it shares a type with![VAR 0114(0025)]
If a Rock-type Pokémon uses the Rock-type move\nStone Edge, the move’s base power of 100 is\r\nmultiplied by 1.5 to become 150.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Ground and Rock may seem like similar types,\nbut if a Ground-type Pokémon uses Stone Edge,\r\nthe move’s power will remain 100.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Supereffective moves and critical hits also add\nmultipliers on to this little numerical increase,\r\nso it most certainly must not be taken lightly.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Let me ask you a question to see if you\nunderstand what I’m talking about here.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Say you have a move with a power of 100. If a\nPokémon that shares a type with this move\r\nuses it and hits an opponent that is weak to\r\nthat type, what happens to that move’s power?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Its power becomes 150
Its power becomes 200
Its power becomes 300
Close! But a power of 150 would only take into\naccount the multiplier of 1.5 resulting from the\r\nPokémon sharing a type with the move.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Close! But a power of 200 would only take into\naccount the doubling effect of using a move\r\nthat is super effective against an opponent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
You did that calculation all in your head? Well\ndone, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0025)]
First, using a move that shares a type with its user\nmultiplies the move’s base power of 100 by 1.5,\r\nmaking the power 150![VAR 0114(0025)]
The fact that the opponent is weak to the move’s\ntype then doubles that power from 150 to 300![VAR 0114(0025)]
The original power of the move ends up being\ntripled! Isn’t that amazing?[VAR 0114(0025)]
What’s more, if a Pokémon Terastallizes and its\nTera Type matches one of its original types, then\r\nthe bonus it gets for using a move of that same\r\ntype increases from 1.5 to 2![VAR 0114(0025)]
Of course, being able to use a lot of moves with\ndifferent types is great as well. That’s one way\r\nyou can surprise your opponent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
In the end, your own innate characteristics are\nwhat will really let you shine the most.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Bear in mind that this is true for both humans and\nPokémon.[VAR 0114(0025)]
It sure would make me happy if you could take\nthose words to heart![VAR 0114(0025)]
But I suppose I should really have shared this\nbasic advice right from our first lesson.\c\nMy apologies...[VAR 0114(0025)]
And just like that, class is over. The last of our\ntime together flew by in the blink of an eye.[VAR 0114(0025)]
It was so much fun to be able to teach all you\neager students about numbers.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Next class will be our fun final exam! Be sure to\nreview the material well in preparation.[VAR 0114(0025)]

My name is Raifort. I will be the one to impart\nknowledge of the past to your little minds.[VAR 0114(0027)]
History is a wonderful thing. Truly splendid.\c\nThe lives of our ancestors throughout history\nforged the path to the present in which we live![VAR 0114(0027)]
Today, you shall learn about the most mysterious\nlocation in all of Paldea—the Great Crater.[VAR 0114(0027)]
As you are all aware, a massive crater known as\nthe Great Crater of Paldea exists in the heart of\r\nour region.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The area inside this crater is called Area Zero,\nand research of its geological strata and material\r\ncomposition has shown that the crater is in fact\r\nover one million years old.[VAR 0114(0027)]
It was long believed that [VAR FF00(0006)]a certain something[VAR FF00(0000)]\nrested at the bottom of this mysterious crater.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Answer me this...[VAR 0114(0027)]
What exactly was believed to rest in the depths\nof the Great Crater—inside Area Zero?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Treasure
A Snorlax
A Pokémon Center
Heh. That is correct! You are a surprisingly clever\none, aren’t you? I see you did your homework\r\nprior to coming to my class.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Incorrect! An adorable answer, to be sure, but\nwere you perhaps fooled by my use of “rest”?\r\nThe correct answer is treasure.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Incorrect! An interesting answer, to be sure, but\nthat would be quite the anachronistic artifact.\r\nThe correct answer is treasure.[VAR 0114(0027)]
That’s right! Some believed that a treasure more\nvaluable than anything else in this world rested in\r\nthe depths of the Great Crater![VAR 0114(0027)]
So much for dreams of treasure hunting, though,\nas a lab has been built in those very same depths.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh, and before I forget—you would all do well\nto remember that the Great Crater and Area\r\nZero are both off-limits to all but those who\r\nhave official business there.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Do not dare entertain the foolish notion of\ngallivanting off to Area Zero in search of riches.\c\nIt is no place for children dreaming of treasure\nand adventure![VAR 0114(0027)]
Besides, if it were at all possible to investigate\nthe area, I would surely be the first to do so![VAR 0114(0027)]
Oho, is that the time already? I must’ve gotten\nswept up in filling your minds with knowledge.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This ends today’s lesson. We will unravel more of\nhistory’s enigmas together next time.[VAR 0114(0027)]

Greetings, my little students. Whatever you did\nyesterday, it is now a part of history.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Today, we will continue to unravel the marvels\nthat history has presented to us.[VAR 0114(0027)]
About two thousand years ago, this region came\nunder the rule of the Paldean Empire.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Historical accounts describe the Paldean emperor\nas being quite the dictator.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This emperor also zealously believed the legend\nof the treasure that rests deep within Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I must mention that the civilizations of our\nancestors were not as developed as ours is today.[VAR 0114(0027)]
People back then were far more likely to believe\nin mysterious legends, magic, and beings beyond\r\nhuman comprehension.[VAR 0114(0027)]
In an attempt to gain the power to stand against\nPaldea’s neighboring countries, the emperor\r\nsent people in droves to join the hunt for the\r\nfabled treasure of Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Answer me this...[VAR 0114(0027)]
Approximately how many years ago was it that\nthe Paldean Empire began to rule this region?[VAR 0114(0027)]
About one thousand years ago
About two thousand years ago
About three thousand years ago
Incorrect! You’re off by an entire millennium!\c\nWhy, one thousand years ago, the Paldean\nEmpire had already begun to collapse![VAR 0114(0027)]
Heh. That is correct!\c\nYou are a surprisingly clever one, aren’t you?\nI see you’re listening intently to my lecture.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Incorrect! You’re off by an entire millennium!\c\nWhy, three thousand years ago, the Paldean\nEmpire didn’t even exist yet![VAR 0114(0027)]
The answer is about two thousand years ago.\nThat is when the Great Era of Exploration began.[VAR 0114(0027)]
However, it is said that not a single adventurer\nsent out by the emperor ever reached the depths\r\nof Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Was it the punishing journey itself that barred\ntheir way? Or perhaps some unknown creature?[VAR 0114(0027)]
The resounding failure of this “Great” Era of\nExploration almost certainly heightened the air\r\nof mystery surrounding the crater.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh, what I wouldn’t give to explore Area Zero in\nits untouched state at that time![VAR 0114(0027)]
I suppose I can only hope for the swift invention\nof a time machine.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oho, is that the time already? I must’ve gotten\nswept up in filling your minds with knowledge.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This ends today’s lesson. We will unravel more of\nhistory’s enigmas together next time.[VAR 0114(0027)]

Greetings, my little students. Whatever you did\nyesterday, it is now a part of history.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Today, we will continue to unravel the marvels\nthat history has presented to us.[VAR 0114(0027)]
As you should remember from our last class,\nArea Zero’s Great Era of Exploration began\r\nabout two thousand years ago.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This era lasted for approximately one thousand\nyears, but not a single soul was able to venture\r\nall the way to the deepest reaches of Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Having poured much of its human and financial\nresources into the exploration of Area Zero for\r\nso long, the Paldean Empire fell into decline.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Two hundred years later—or eight hundred years\nago—the empire and its surrounding nations\r\nunited into one entity.\c\nThis was the formation of Paldea as we know it\ntoday.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Ah yes, this very academy where you’re now\nfilling your young minds with knowledge was also\r\napparently established at that time.[VAR 0114(0027)]
In fact, this school building—though certainly\nhaving undergone repairs through the years—\r\nis just as it was when it was built so long ago.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This very structure is a piece of history! Ahh!\nThings of old are truly splendid![VAR 0114(0027)]
I would certainly prefer it not to have the Poké\nBall portion, though—a relatively new addition.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
Let’s see if you’ve been listening to my lecture.\c\nTell me—approximately how many years ago\nwas this academy of ours established?[VAR 0114(0027)]
About six hundred years ago
About seven hundred years ago
About eight hundred years ago
Incorrect! You are missing two hundred years of\nsplendid history![VAR 0114(0027)]
Incorrect! You are missing one hundred years of\nsplendid history![VAR 0114(0027)]
Correct! I see the look of concentration on your\nface was indeed just that.\c\nI hate nothing more than when a student only\npretends to listen.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This academy was constructed exactly 805 years\nago, to be precise. In other words, your academy\r\nhere is 805 years old![VAR 0114(0027)]
At the time, it offered state-of-the-art facilities\nand a uniquely innovative curriculum. As such,\r\npeople used to say...[VAR 0114(0027)]
“Those seeking knowledge need look no further\nthan the oranges of Paldea.”\c\nThat’s right—they were referring to Naranja\nAcademy![VAR 0114(0027)]
“Those seeking knowledge need look no further\nthan the grapes of Paldea.”\c\nThat’s right—they were referring to Uva\nAcademy![VAR 0114(0027)]
It is said that this proverb of sorts was even used\noutside of the Paldea region.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oho, is that the time already? I must’ve gotten\nswept up in filling your minds with knowledge.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This ends today’s lesson. Our next class will be\nour midterm exam.\c\nBring the wonders of history to the forefront of\nyour minds in preparation.[VAR 0114(0027)]

Your time is up! Put your writing utensils down![VAR 0114(0027)]
That last question was a freebie. Even the least\ncapable of you surely padded your score there.\r\nI sincerely hope you did, anyway.[VAR 0114(0027)]
So ends our midterm examination. You may ask\nfor your scores at the school’s front desk.[VAR 0114(0027)]

Greetings, my little students. Whatever you did\nyesterday, it is now a part of history.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I was hoping to continue unraveling the marvels\nthat history has presented to us today.\c\nHowever, I imagine your ability to concentrate\nhas been spectacularly derailed by my midterm.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I suppose changing things up for fun and variety\nmay be a good idea every now and then.[VAR 0114(0027)]
So allow me to tell you an old fairy tale that has\nbeen passed down in Paldea for generations.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Once upon a time, there was a king who very\nmuch enjoyed collecting treasure.[VAR 0114(0027)]
He was particularly fond of treasures from\nother countries.\c\nOne day, a merchant from the East heard rumors\nof this king and came to meet him.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The merchant laid out four treasures in front of\nthe treasure-loving king.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The four treasures were as follows: a vessel, a\nsword, a set of tablets, and a set of beads.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Seeing such rarities before him, the king leaped\nfor joy.[VAR 0114(0027)]
He showered the merchant with gold coins and\nclaimed all four of the treasures for himself.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Answer me this...[VAR 0114(0027)]
I said that one of the treasures was a “set of\ntablets.” What do you think these tablets were?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Wooden planks for writing on
Handheld electronic devices
Medicine that you chew
Correct! Your daily pursuit of knowledge serves\nyou well.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Incorrect! Is that some kind of joke? Were you\nexpecting me to laugh at your assumption that\r\nelectronic tablets existed in the distant past?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Incorrect! Is that some kind of joke? Were you\nexpecting me to laugh at the notion that\r\nchewable tablets would be considered treasure?[VAR 0114(0027)]
These particular tablets were wooden and used\nas a writing medium in the East in ancient times.[VAR 0114(0027)]
As you may know, they fell out of popular use\nas paper become more universally available.[VAR 0114(0027)]
For the king to consider these paper substitutes\ntreasures, they must have been of superb quality.\c\nThat, or perhaps they had some amazingly\nprofound teachings written on them.[VAR 0114(0027)]
So, the king obtained these four treasures, and\non that very night...[VAR 0114(0027)]
it is said that a terrible disaster rained down upon\nhis castle, reducing it to rubble by dawn.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oho, is that the time already? I wasn’t done with\nmy story, but alas. So ends today’s lesson.[VAR 0114(0027)]
If you are interested in how the story ends,\nyou may come see me outside class hours.[VAR 0114(0027)]

Greetings, my little students. Whatever you did\nyesterday, it is now a part of history.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Today, we will continue to unravel the marvels\nthat history has presented to us.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I trust that you all remember our lesson before\nthe midterm exam concerning the Great Crater\r\nof Paldea and its interior—Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This mysterious crater captured the imaginations\nof many—including the former Paldean emperor.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Two hundred years ago, a group of explorers\nclaimed to have finally reached its depths.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The name of the team that achieved this great\nfeat was the Area Zero Expedition.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The team is said to have been made up of\nPaldea’s best and brightest.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Skilled battlers, brilliant researchers—talented\nindividuals of all kinds.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Among the list of team members was the name\nof a man who was an author and brilliant natural\r\nhistorian: [VAR FF00(0006)]Heath[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
After returning from the expedition to Area Zero,\nhe used his literary talent to record the events of\r\nthe expedition and publish them.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
Let’s see if you were paying attention.\c\nWhat was the name of the team that first made it\nto the deepest reaches of the Great Crater?[VAR 0114(0027)]
The Area Zero Adventurers
The Area Zero Expedition
The Area Zero Survey Corps
Incorrect! I see that even your little head has\nbecome full of dreams of adventure.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Correct! To pick up on and remember a term I\nsimply slipped into the flow of the lecture...\r\nYou really are quite the clever one.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Incorrect! Though I will admit that an expedition\nand a survey corps may take part in very\r\nsimilar activities![VAR 0114(0027)]
The correct name for this team was the Area\nZero Expedition![VAR 0114(0027)]
The record of their activities written by the\nexpedition member Heath can be found in\r\nbookstores and the like even today.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This record is now known as the[VAR FF00(0006)] Scarlet Book[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
This record is now known as the[VAR FF00(0006)] Violet Book[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
At the time, the entire region of Paldea was\nabsolutely buzzing about Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The Scarlet Book was so popular that practically\neveryone had a copy.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The Violet Book was so popular that practically\neveryone had a copy.[VAR 0114(0027)]
However, the book itself was full of fantastical\ndescriptions and illustrations of things that could\r\nnever be thought of as real.\c\nThe masses began to call Heath a liar.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Even the truth of the expedition making it to the\nbottom of the crater was called into question.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The Scarlet Book was condemned to the shelves\nof used bookstores as just another book of wild\r\nparanormal stories.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The Violet Book was condemned to the shelves\nof used bookstores as just another book of wild\r\nparanormal stories.[VAR 0114(0027)]
There’s a copy on one of the bookshelves on the\nground floor of the entrance hall.\c\nFeel free to have a read if you’re interested.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oho, is that the time already? I must’ve gotten\nswept up in filling your minds with knowledge.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This ends today’s lesson. We will unravel more of\nhistory’s enigmas together next time.[VAR 0114(0027)]

Greetings, my little students. Whatever you did\nyesterday, it is now a part of history.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Today is our last class, so I would like to unravel\nthe marvels that history has presented to us\r\none last time.[VAR 0114(0027)]
In our last class, I taught you about the Area Zero\nExpedition of two hundred years ago, correct?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Alas, two hundred years is not that long ago.\nNot that long ago at all.[VAR 0114(0027)]
How unfortunate that our history lessons must\nmarch so inexorably toward the future.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Would it not be more of an adventure to march\ntoward the past instead?\c\nTo start from our present and study history\nin reverse?![VAR 0114(0027)]
I think it would!
That might be hard to follow...
[VAR BD06(0000)]So you agree with me, do you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nHowever, I’m afraid I risk incurring the wrath of\nour dear director if I stray from the curriculum.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Indeed. It may be difficult to understand the\nflow of events—how one thing leads to another—\r\nif we were to trace history in reverse.[VAR 0114(0027)]
*sigh* I suppose I have no choice but to let the\nflow of time carry us toward the future.[VAR 0114(0027)]
In this last class of ours, I shall fill your minds with\nthe history of the Terastal phenomenon.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The technology behind Tera Orbs has its origins\nin Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Even after the Area Zero Expedition supposedly\nreached the crater’s deepest depths, others\r\ncontinued to explore that area...[VAR 0114(0027)]
And, around 140 years ago, Pokémon cloaked\nin a mysterious light were discovered there.[VAR 0114(0027)]
As you may have already guessed, these were, in\nfact, Terastallized Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0027)]
However, when those who discovered these\nPokémon brought them out of Area Zero, the\r\nlight faded, and the Terastal phenomenon\r\nremained a mystery for quite some time.[VAR 0114(0027)]
However, 10 years ago—ugh, that might as well\nbe present day—a certain someone you have\r\ndefinitely heard of unraveled this mystery.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Answer me this...[VAR 0114(0027)]
What is the name of the famous professor who\nunraveled the Terastal phenomenon mystery?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Professor Heath
Professor Sada
Professor Turo
Professor Clavell
Incorrect! Heath is the one who wrote the record\nof the Area Zero Expedition’s activities. You must\r\nbe remembering our last class together.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Correct! To think that you—a new transfer to our\nacademy—could correctly answer this question...\r\nYou must be very diligent in your studies.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Incorrect! Or, no...perhaps you are correct, in a\nroundabout sort of way...[VAR 0114(0027)]
Approximately 10 years ago, a professor\nnamed Sada unraveled the mystery of the\r\nTerastal phenomenon.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Approximately 10 years ago, a professor\nnamed Turo unraveled the mystery of the\r\nTerastal phenomenon.[VAR 0114(0027)]
She discovered that the shining crystals down in\nArea Zero—or rather, the energy they emit—is\r\nwhat causes Pokémon to Terastallize.[VAR 0114(0027)]
He discovered that the shining crystals down in\nArea Zero—or rather, the energy they emit—is\r\nwhat causes Pokémon to Terastallize.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This led the professor to invent Tera Orb\ntechnology and to develop a practical use for it.\c\nThis technology was then shared with both the\nPokémon League and our academy.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Rumor has it that Director Clavell was one of the\nresearchers on the professor’s team...[VAR 0114(0027)]
Alas. This story is much less exciting now that\nsomeone we all know appears in it.\c\nModern history truly is dull, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Thus ends my history classes. Our next session\nwill be our final exam.\c\nBring the wonders of history to the forefront of\nyour minds in preparation.[VAR 0114(0027)]

Your time is up! Put your writing utensils down![VAR 0114(0027)]

Merci beaucoup! That is, thank you very much for\nyour attention here in my class![VAR 0114(0026)]
I’m so heureux—or happy—for this chance to\nre-experience my younger days with you all![VAR 0114(0026)]
Do you know what “Salvatore” means? It means\n“savior”! So just imagine I’m here to SAVE you\r\nfrom spooooky new languages. Haha! Funny, no?[VAR 0114(0026)]
That’s right! My classes will teach you about\nvarious languages from different regions.[VAR 0114(0026)]
You may say “Good morning!” or “Hello!” as a\ngreeting, but people from elsewhere may say\r\n“Bonjour!” or “Salut!”[VAR 0114(0026)]
I’ve heard there’s even a popular streamer out\nthere who smashes several languages together\r\nand says “’Ello, ’ello, hola! Ciao and bonjour!”[VAR 0114(0026)]
There are so many regions out there in our world,\nand each can have their own unique languages![VAR 0114(0026)]
Gracias, merci, xièxie, arigato, danke—these all\nhave the same meaning! Can you guess what it is?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Good-bye
Thank you
Good night
Oh! [VAR 0100(0000)], was it?\c\nThat’s not quite right, but your willingness to\nspeak up will serve you well in language learning![VAR 0114(0026)]
Waouh! [VAR 0100(0000)], was it?\c\nBrav[VAR 1100(00FF,0101)]oa! That’s correct! And speaking up is\nimportant in language learning, too![VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh! [VAR 0100(0000)], was it?\c\nThat’s not quite right, but your willingness to\nspeak up will serve you well in language learning![VAR 0114(0026)]
Gracias, merci, xièxie—these words all mean\n“thank you.” I guess some of you probably knew\r\nat least one of those![VAR 0114(0026)]
Despite meaning the same thing, their lengths\nand sounds are all different! Isn’t that interesting?[VAR 0114(0026)]
And now, apropos of nothing, let me give you\nall one of my wise words of advice![VAR 0114(0026)]
When you travel abroad, you should try to speak\nthe local language as much as you can—even if\r\nyou can’t speak it very well![VAR 0114(0026)]
I’m sure your willingness to try will make the\npeople you meet très heureux—very happy![VAR 0114(0026)]
Honestly, from my experience, just being able to\nsay “hello,” “delicious,” and “thank you” in the\r\nlocal language will get you pretty far.[VAR 0114(0026)]
For everything else, just pretend you’re Mr. Mime\nand gesture away![VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh! There’s that pesky bell. I guess that’s all the\ntime we have for today![VAR 0114(0026)]
Well, adios! Mata ne! À la prochaine! See you\nlater, everyone![VAR 0114(0026)]

Oui!
C’est super![VAR 0114(0026)]
In our last class, I believe I taught you all how to\nsay “thank you” in other languages, right?[VAR 0114(0026)]
In le cours d’aujourd’hui—today’s class—we will\nlearn about a certain word sure to make people\r\nhappy when you use it in your travels abroad![VAR 0114(0026)]
What word, you ask? Well, you’ll have to guess!\nDélicieux! Hǎochī! Buono! Can anyone tell me\r\nwhat these words mean?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Delicious
Sorry
Help
Waouh! Correct! C’est super! I knew I could\ncount on you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nIf sorry really did “cut it,” as they say, the justice\nsystem would be inutile—unnecessary! Sorry,\r\nbut that’s a mauvaise réponse—a wrong answer![VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI hear your SOS! Don’t worry! I’ll SAVE you,\nor my name’s not Salvatore! That was a mauvaise\r\nréponse—a wrong answer—but I hear you![VAR 0114(0026)]
Délicieux! Hǎochī! Buono! All of these words\nmean “delicious”![VAR 0114(0026)]
Using the local word for “delicious” at markets or\nrestaurants is sure to get a big sourire—a smile,\r\nthat is—from whoever you’re talking to![VAR 0114(0026)]
It’ll make communication go more smoothly—\nI guarantee it![VAR 0114(0026)]
People love it when someone says the cuisine of\ntheir homeland is delicious! Who wouldn’t be\r\nheureux—happy—to receive such a compliment?[VAR 0114(0026)]
And now, apropos of nothing, let me give you\nall one of my wise words of advice![VAR 0114(0026)]
The first step to smooth communication is to\ncompliment the person you’re talking to![VAR 0114(0026)]
After all, it’s not very likely that a compliment\nwould put someone in a bad mood![VAR 0114(0026)]
This doesn’t only apply to people in other\nregions, either! It’s the same for all of you, too!\r\nYou can put this tip to use with your classmates![VAR 0114(0026)]
How about you all try complimenting each other\nafter class? I bet it will make for an ambiance\r\nplus sympathique—a more friendly atmosphere![VAR 0114(0026)]
That’s all for today! See you all au prochain\ncours—next lesson, that is! Adios! Mata ne![VAR 0114(0026)]

My dear friends! How ARE you all today?\nYou certainly look fantastic![VAR 0114(0026)]
It’s time for another one of Salvatore’s Language\nLessons! Êtes-vous prêts—are you ready?![VAR 0114(0026)]
... ... ...\n... ... ...\r\nAhem. Êtes-vous prêts—are you ready?![VAR 0114(0026)]
Y-yes!
O-oui!
Très bien! Very good![VAR 0114(0026)]
My lessons are not a one-way street! Non non!\nI am très triste when no one speaks up!\r\nVery sad, that is![VAR 0114(0026)]
In our last class, I believe I taught you all how to\nsay “delicious” in other languages, right?[VAR 0114(0026)]
In le cours d’aujourd’hui—today’s class—we will\nlearn about a very special phrase that you can\r\nput to use when the time is juuust right![VAR 0114(0026)]
Ai shiteiru! Je t’aime! Te amo! Ich liebe dich!\nDoes anyone know what these phrases mean?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Time to eat
I love you
I’m going home
Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nNon non! We can’t have you eating anyone!\nThat’s a mauvaise réponse—a wrong answer![VAR 0114(0026)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Fantastique, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Correct!\nYou\r\ndeserve\r\na\r\nmédaille\r\nd’or—a\r\ngold medal![VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nNon non! I can’t let you go home just yet!\nThat’s a mauvaise réponse—a wrong answer![VAR 0114(0026)]
Je t’aime! Te amo! Ich liebe dich! These three\nphrases you may know, I think! Why? Because\r\nthey’re all quite famous ways to say “I love you!”[VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh, my! Have I embarrassed you all, my friends?\nWhat timides little garçons et filles—shy boys\r\nand girls, that is![VAR 0114(0026)]
It’s so very important to express your feelings\nabout things to others, you know! This is\r\nESPECIALLY true for positive emotions![VAR 0114(0026)]
If you get married someday and argue with your\nspouse over some silly little thing...[VAR 0114(0026)]
All you have to do is apologize and say “I love\nyou” et tout ira bien—and all will be well, that is![VAR 0114(0026)]
I should know! Why, just last week, I had a big\nargument with ma femme—my dear wife, that is!\r\nBut I was quick to say I’m sorry, and all was well![VAR 0114(0026)]
And now, apropos of nothing, let me give you\nall one of my wise words of advice![VAR 0114(0026)]
It’s best to be quick to apologize when you have\nan argument with someone![VAR 0114(0026)]
That goes for your families, friends, AND your\ncrushes! I know you can do it! I believe in you![VAR 0114(0026)]
Our prochain cours—our next class—will be the\nmidterm exam! Be sure to review what we learned\r\nin all our lessons so far! Adios! Mata ne![VAR 0114(0026)]

I’m sure you all did great! Bravo, my friends! You\ncan check your scores at the school’s front desk.[VAR 0114(0026)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : class_d_05.dat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How did you like the midterm exam? You all did\nreally great![VAR 0114(0026)]
We’re halfway there! And now, time for another\nlesson! Êtes-vous prêts—are you ready?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Yes!
Oui!
Très bonne réponse—great answer! Merci, my\nfriends! I knew I could count on you stars.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Leading up to the midterm, we learned all sorts\nof words from different regions![VAR 0114(0026)]
Starting today, though, I’ll be throwing a curve\nball—for we begin listening comprehension![VAR 0114(0026)]
Vas-y—go for it, my assistant! Pika pi, Pikachu![VAR 0114(0026)]
Pikachu!
As you just heard, Pokémon can also use words\nto communicate![VAR 0114(0026)]
It’s not always easy for us to understand them,\nbut their words have meaning—just as ours do.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Pokémon can use language to share all kinds of\ninformation with each other—like the location of\r\nfood or whether there may be predators nearby![VAR 0114(0026)]
The same Pokémon’s cries may sound different\ndepending on what it wants to say![VAR 0114(0026)]
I’m sure you’re all curious, so aujourd’hui—today,\nthat is—let’s learn some Pokémon language![VAR 0114(0026)]
Je t’en prie—if you would be so kind, Pikachu![VAR 0114(0026)]
Piggah!
What emotion do you suppose Pikachu was\ntrying to convey just now?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Happiness
Sadness
Anger
Say it again, Pikachu!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)], that’s not right!\nPokémon\r\nlanguage\r\nis\r\nhard,\r\nisn’t it?[VAR 0114(0026)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)], that’s not right!\nPokémon\r\nlanguage\r\nis\r\nhard,\r\nisn’t it?[VAR 0114(0026)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Merveilleux, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Correct!\nI guess\r\nwe\r\nshould\r\ncall\r\nyou “Professor”![VAR 0114(0026)]
When Pikachu says...[VAR 0114(0026)]
Piggah!
It’s using its angry voice![VAR 0114(0026)]
That’s right—I had my little Pikachu friend here\npretend to be angry for us![VAR 0114(0026)]
Don’t you think he did a great job? Give Pikachu\na round of applause, everyone![VAR 0114(0026)]
*clapping*
The same Pokémon can even communicate its\nfeelings in many different ways![VAR 0114(0026)]
Their voices change depending on their mood\nand physical condition.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Try listening more carefully to Pokémon—you\nmight gain a deeper understanding of them![VAR 0114(0026)]
That having been said, Pokémon are quite\nmysterious creatures![VAR 0114(0026)]
Some actually don’t communicate with words at\nall, but instead use things like electromagnetic\r\nor ultrasonic waves—some even use telepathy![VAR 0114(0026)]
And now, apropos of nothing, let me give you\nall one of my wise words of advice![VAR 0114(0026)]
If you poke at your Pokémon too many times\nwhile washing them during picnics, they’ll get\r\nmad at you like Pikachu just demonstrated![VAR 0114(0026)]
Well, adios! Mata ne! À la prochaine! See you\nlater, everyone![VAR 0114(0026)]

It’s time for another of Salvatore’s Language\nLessons! Êtes-vous prêts—are you ready?![VAR 0114(0026)]
Yes!
Oui!
I would expect no less from my excellent friends!\nEven your replies to my questions are excellent![VAR 0114(0026)]
Aujourd’hui—today—we will once again be\nfocusing on listening![VAR 0114(0026)]
Vas-y—go for it, my assistant! Pika pi, Pikachu![VAR 0114(0026)]
Pikachu!
As you may remember from our last class,\nthe same Pokémon’s cries may sound different\r\ndepending on what it wants to say![VAR 0114(0026)]
Aujourd’hui—today, that is—we will be learning\nmore about the language used by Pokémon![VAR 0114(0026)]
Je t’en prie—if you would be so kind, Pikachu![VAR 0114(0026)]
Pikaaa...
Hmmm! That sounds a little bleak, doesn’t it? Its\nvoice seems a little lower pitched, too![VAR 0114(0026)]
What emotion do you suppose Pikachu was\ntrying to convey just now?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Happiness
Sadness
Surprise
Say it again, Pikachu!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh no, [VAR 0100(0000)]! That’s\nincorrect.\c\nAu contraire—on the contrary, I believe it’s\nthe opposite![VAR 0114(0026)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ding ding ding! That’s right,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]! Fantastique![VAR 0114(0026)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh no, [VAR 0100(0000)]! That’s\nincorrect.\r\nUnless,\r\nperhaps,\r\nPikachu\r\nwas\r\nso\r\nsurprised\r\nthat\r\nit\r\ndropped\r\na\r\ntasty Berry![VAR 0114(0026)]
When Pikachu says...[VAR 0114(0026)]
Pikaaa...
It’s expressing sadness! Kind of makes you want\nto cry, doesn’t it?[VAR 0114(0026)]
That’s right—I had my little Pikachu cry as if it\nwas...crying! Haha! Funny joke, right?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Don’t you think it did a great job? Give Pikachu\na round of applause, everyone![VAR 0114(0026)]
*clapping*
And now, apropos of nothing, let me give you\nall one of my wise words of advice![VAR 0114(0026)]
If you hear one of your Pokémon making sad\nnoises like this one, you should treat them with\r\neven more kindness than usual.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Well, you probably already knew that, though! A\npiece of cake for you all, I’m sure![VAR 0114(0026)]
Of course, this goes for your classmates and\nothers as well![VAR 0114(0026)]
Friends should support each other in times of\nsadness! I truly hope that you all can have smiles\r\non your faces all the time, my friends![VAR 0114(0026)]
Our prochain cours—next lesson, that is—will be\nour final lesson together! I hope you’re ready for\r\nthe climactic finale! Adios! Mata ne![VAR 0114(0026)]

It’s time for the last of Salvatore’s Language\nLessons! Êtes-vous prêts—are you ready?![VAR 0114(0026)]
Yes!
Oui!
What a réponse fantastique—great answer, that\nis! Perfect for our last class together! I love it![VAR 0114(0026)]
And aujourd’hui—today—we will once again be\nhaving a listening lesson![VAR 0114(0026)]
Vas-y—go for it, my assistant! Pika pi, Pikachu![VAR 0114(0026)]
Pikachu!
Let’s get right to it, my little Pikachu friend![VAR 0114(0026)]
For our last listening class...tell everyone how\nyou’re feeling right now, s’il te plaît![VAR 0114(0026)]
Chaaa!
Oooh! Can you feel that? That’s one contagious\nemotion in Pikachu’s voice![VAR 0114(0026)]
What emotion do you suppose Pikachu was\ntrying to convey just now?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Happiness
Pain
Surprise
Say it again, Pikachu!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Well done, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’m so\nHAPPY\r\nthat\r\nyou\r\ngot\r\nit\r\nright!\r\nHaha!\r\nGet it?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh, my! Did Pikachu sound like it was in pain to\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh, my! Did Pikachu sound surprised to\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0026)]
When Pikachu says...[VAR 0114(0026)]
Chaaa!
It’s expressing happiness! Doesn’t it make you\njust want to break out into a happy dance?[VAR 0114(0026)]
But I didn’t have to ask Pikachu to put on an act\ntoday. Oh no—I simply asked it to show you all\r\nhow it felt about getting to have class with you![VAR 0114(0026)]
Getting to meet so many new friends and study\ntogether in this class with you...[VAR 0114(0026)]
It’s made both me and my little Pikachu so\nvery happy![VAR 0114(0026)]
And now, apropos of nothing, let me give you\nall one last wise word of advice![VAR 0114(0026)]
As you live your lives, I’m sure you will all have\ntimes when you get mad or sad—maybe even\r\nmore than you would like![VAR 0114(0026)]
Everything has its ups and downs. Life is a\nveritable roller coaster![VAR 0114(0026)]
But, à la fin—in the end, that is—there is surely\nhappiness waiting for you!\c\nSo gardez le sourire—keep a smile on your face—\neven in the hardest of times![VAR 0114(0026)]
Chaaa!
When you’re faced with a problem that you can’t\nhandle alone, find someone to rely on, be it a\r\nteacher, your family, your friends—anyone![VAR 0114(0026)]

Osu! Say hello to your battle instructor—\nThe one! The only! The hot-blooded Dendra!\c\n“Osu” is a karate thing, by the way. Look it up![VAR 0114(0024)]
My age? 25! My hobby? Working out!\nMy...type?! Well...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Strong and muscular Fighting types, of course![VAR 0114(0024)]
That’s all for my introduction! As for my class,\nthis is where you all get to learn the nitty-gritty\r\nof Pokémon battling![VAR 0114(0024)]
We’ll start with the basics so that no Trainer gets\nleft in the dust! Even if you’re new to this stuff,\r\nhave no fear![VAR 0114(0024)]
Leave it to me and my muscles, and you’ll be\npros in no time.\c\nLet’s set our fighting spirits ablaze—together![VAR 0114(0024)]
Pokémon have all kinds of attack moves at their\ndisposal, and each move has certain qualities\r\nthat you’ll want to remember![VAR 0114(0024)]
I’m talking about the power, type, and [VAR FF00(0006)]category[VAR FF00(0000)]\nof these moves![VAR 0114(0024)]
Higher power means more damage—especially if\nyour opponent is weak to that move’s type![VAR 0114(0024)]
Heads up, new kid! Question coming your way!\c\nThere are two categories that attack moves can\nfall under. Know what they are?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Moves of light and moves of darkness
Physical moves and special moves
Moves you love and moves you hate
That’s not only wrong—it’s totally out there!\c\nAre you OK, new kid?! Or are you just at that\nage where you’re really into fantasy stuff?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Awesome! You’re just as sharp as I expected, new\nkid! Looks like you have a handle on the basics![VAR 0114(0024)]
That’s not only wrong—it’s kinda sad!\c\nAre you OK, new kid?! Or are you just at that\nage where you’re really into bittersweet stuff?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Anyway, attack moves are split into two\ncategories—[VAR FF00(0006)]physical[VAR FF00(0000)] and [VAR FF00(0006)]special[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0024)]
Physical moves do more damage the higher the\nPokémon’s [VAR FF00(0006)]Attack[VAR FF00(0000)] stat is![VAR 0114(0024)]
And special moves do more damage the higher\nthe Pokémon’s [VAR FF00(0006)]Sp. Atk[VAR FF00(0000)] stat is![VAR 0114(0024)]
On the other side of things, Pokémon getting hit\nby these moves can take less damage by having\r\na high [VAR FF00(0006)]Defense[VAR FF00(0000)] or [VAR FF00(0006)]Sp. Def [VAR FF00(0000)]stat, respectively![VAR 0114(0024)]
In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
Pokémon that are good with [VAR FF00(0006)]physical moves[VAR FF00(0000)]\nshould raise their [VAR FF00(0006)]Attack[VAR FF00(0000)] stat!\c\nAnd Pokémon that are good with [VAR FF00(0006)]special moves[VAR FF00(0000)]\nshould raise their [VAR FF00(0006)]Sp. Atk[VAR FF00(0000)] stat![VAR 0114(0024)]
Trying to raise both of these stats equally will just\nmake it hard for the Pokémon to shine in battle![VAR 0114(0024)]
Make your strong points stronger, I always say—\nthat goes for both people and Pokémon![VAR 0114(0024)]
Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we’re out of time...[VAR 0114(0024)]
We’ll generally meet for my class here in the\nschoolyard—even for book learning!\c\nNothing like a little fresh air to make studying\nmore fun, am I right?[VAR 0114(0024)]
But class is over for now! Take care, you little\nrascals![VAR 0114(0024)]

Another day, another round of battle study! Osu!\nLet’s get right to it![VAR 0114(0024)]
Is everyone excited about the Treasure Hunt?![VAR 0114(0024)]
It’s always a great adventure! You get to take on\nGyms, go to new places, and run all over the\r\nplace with your partner Pokémon![VAR 0114(0024)]
And, while you’re running around out there,\nI’ll bet you’ll come across some big, shining\r\n[VAR FF00(0006)]crystals [VAR FF00(0000)]fairly often as well.[VAR 0114(0024)]
These crystals are actually collections of Terastal\nenergy that’s seeped up out of the ground![VAR 0114(0024)]
You can check out these crystals to battle Tera\nPokémon with your friends or other Trainers in a\r\ngroup of four.[VAR 0114(0024)]
We call those battles...Tera Raid Battles![VAR 0114(0024)]
The Tera Pokémon you’ll face off against in Tera\nRaid Battles are crazy tough![VAR 0114(0024)]
They sometimes act differently than regular\nPokémon, so you’ll need to be on your guard![VAR 0114(0024)]
Luckily, Trainers can also use a special action in\nTera Raid Battles. It’s called [VAR FF00(0006)]cheering[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0024)]
And there are three different cheers you can use![VAR 0114(0024)]
The first cheer is “[VAR FF00(0006)]Go all out![VAR FF00(0000)]” It boosts the\nAttack and Sp. Atk of all ally Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0024)]
The second is “[VAR FF00(0006)]Hang tough![VAR FF00(0000)]” This one boosts\nthe Defense and Sp. Def of all ally Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0024)]
And the third— Well, let’s see if you can guess![VAR 0114(0024)]
This cheer restores HP for all ally Pokémon.\nWhat do you think it is?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Heal up!
Wham-Bam Potion!
Explosive healing wave!
That’s right! Maybe I should make YOU the battle\nteacher, huh, new kid?![VAR 0114(0024)]
Wham-Bam Potion?! That sounds less like a cheer\nand more like a seriously heavy-handed medical\r\ntreatment or something![VAR 0114(0024)]
Explosive healing wave?! That’s a wild answer if\nI ever heard one! But I think I’d like to give that\r\nmove a whirl if it really existed![VAR 0114(0024)]
The third and final cheer is “[VAR FF00(0006)]Heal up![VAR FF00(0000)]” It’s a real\npowerhouse, with the ability to both restore HP\r\nand cure status conditions![VAR 0114(0024)]
You can cheer up to three times during a single\nTera Raid Battle.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Also, cheering uses up a turn in battle, so you\nwon’t be able to have your Pokémon use any of\r\ntheir moves when you cheer![VAR 0114(0024)]
In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
Try everything at your disposal! If nothing seems\nto be working, try cheering on your allies![VAR 0114(0024)]
Providing support for your team can sometimes\nopen up a new realm of possibilities![VAR 0114(0024)]
Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we’re out of time...[VAR 0114(0024)]

Another day, another round of battle study! Osu!\nLet’s get right to it![VAR 0114(0024)]
Last time, we learned about Tera Raid Battles!\nDid any of you have a chance to try them out?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Tera Pokémon are super strong! And the more\ndifficult ones will use an even tougher tactic that\r\nyou’ll need to deal with.[VAR 0114(0024)]
I’m talking about their [VAR FF00(0006)]Tera Shield[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0024)]
What happens while a Pokémon has its\nTera Shield up, you ask?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Well, it’ll take WAAAY less damage, for one![VAR 0114(0024)]
It has a big effect on morale, too![VAR 0114(0024)]
When Trainers see that shield go up, they feel\ndoomed—like there’s no way to win the battle![VAR 0114(0024)]
So, here’s a question for you![VAR 0114(0024)]
If the Pokémon you’re battling puts up its Tera\nShield, what should you do?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Close your eyes and give in
Call your parents
Terastallize and attack it
What?! Don’t just accept defeat! You should be\nable to find a way out of this predicament if you\r\nkeep on fighting![VAR 0114(0024)]
What?! Don’t call your family to tell them you’re\nabout to lose! You should be able to find a way\r\nout of this predicament if you keep on fighting![VAR 0114(0024)]
That’s right! You’re a regular Tera Raid Battle\nmaster, aren’t you, new kid?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Regular attacks don’t work so well against\nPokémon that have their Tera Shield up.[VAR 0114(0024)]
But having your Pokémon Terastallize is an\neffective method to overcome that issue!\c\nA Terastallized Pokémon will do more damage\nto shielded Pokémon—especially if it uses moves\r\nthat match its Tera Type![VAR 0114(0024)]
Dealing enough damage to a Pokémon with its\nTera Shield up can destroy the shield and break\r\nthe Pokémon’s stance![VAR 0114(0024)]
This means that it’s important to properly time\nyour Terastallizing in Tera Raid Battles.[VAR 0114(0024)]
In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
As they say, fight fire with fire and Tera\nPokémon with Tera Pokémon![VAR 0114(0024)]
Be sure to work together with your teammates to\nsmash through your opponent’s Tera Shield![VAR 0114(0024)]
Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we’re out of time once again...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Next class will be our midterm exam! Aim for a\nperfect score! Osu! Osu![VAR 0114(0024)]

I guess we can do our tests in the classroom, at\nleast! It might be hard to write your answers out\r\non the field![VAR 0114(0024)]
All right! Time to put on your game faces and do\nbattle with those test sheets![VAR 0114(0024)]

Time’s up! Put your pencils down![VAR 0114(0024)]
I saw you giving it everything you’ve got! I’m sure\nyou’ll all get perfect scores![VAR 0114(0024)]
Well done, everyone. You can ask for your scores\nat the front desk![VAR 0114(0024)]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another day, another round of battle study! Osu!\nLet’s get right to it![VAR 0114(0024)]
You all gave everything you had on the midterm\nexams. Well done![VAR 0114(0024)]
We’ll resume our regular classes today, so keep\nup that energy for the second half of the term![VAR 0114(0024)]
Have you all been using the R Button to send out\nyour Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0024)]
If you do, your Pokémon will run off in the\ndirection you’re facing.[VAR 0114(0024)]
It’s a super-useful tactic that lets your Pokémon\npick up faraway items for you. And that’s not all![VAR 0114(0024)]
If there’s a wild Pokémon near where you sent\nyour Pokémon, they’ll start battling each other![VAR 0114(0024)]
We call those battles...Auto Battles![VAR 0114(0024)]
Just as the name implies, your Pokémon will\nact on its own during Auto Battles—meaning\r\nyou won’t have to give it any commands![VAR 0114(0024)]
And if your Pokémon wins, it’ll get Exp. Points\njust like it would in a regular battle.[VAR 0114(0024)]
If you make good use of these battles, they can\nbe a really efficient way to train your party![VAR 0114(0024)]
But you’ll want to remember that Pokémon won’t\nevolve or learn new moves right away if they level\r\nup from an Auto Battle.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Also, if a Pokémon LOSES an Auto Battle, it’ll\ncome back with just a small amount of HP left.\r\nMake sure to heal it up right away![VAR 0114(0024)]
Whoops. I just about did the whole class as a\none-sided lecture. Does anyone have any\r\nquestions so far?[VAR 0114(0024)]
How do I stop an Auto Battle?
Can I catch wild Pokémon in Auto Battles?
No questions here!
There’s no stopping an Auto Battle once it starts!\nYou’ll have to wait and see how it plays out!\c\nYou can call your Pokémon off before the battle\nstarts, though, if you press the ZR Button while\r\nyour Pokémon is still on its way to the opponent![VAR 0114(0024)]
If you let your Pokémon battle on its own, it’ll\nkeep going until its opponent is defeated!\c\nIf you want to catch a wild Pokémon, you’ll need\nto battle by issuing commands instead![VAR 0114(0024)]
Great! You’re all really good at this. I can’t wait\nto see where you go from here![VAR 0114(0024)]
Even during Auto Battles, our Pokémon are out\nthere battling for us—their Trainers![VAR 0114(0024)]
Keep an eye on them as much as possible, and\nif it looks like they’re going to lose, be sure to\r\nhave them retreat![VAR 0114(0024)]
Also, this goes without saying, but Pokémon with\nlow HP are already worn out.[VAR 0114(0024)]
They probably won’t enjoy Auto Battles as much,\nso don’t work them too hard, OK?[VAR 0114(0024)]
In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
Auto Battles only work if a Trainer and their\nPokémon have a relationship of mutual trust![VAR 0114(0024)]
Be smart with how you use Auto Battles so you\ndon’t lose the trust of your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0024)]
Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we’ve run out of time, as usual...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Class is over for now! Take care, you little rascals![VAR 0114(0024)]

Text File : class_e_06.dat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another day, another round of battle study! Osu!\nLet’s get right to it![VAR 0114(0024)]
I hope you gave Auto Battles a shot like we\ntalked about last class![VAR 0114(0024)]
Making good use of Auto Battles will let you train\nup a bunch of different Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0024)]
It’s also an efficient way to gather the Pokémon\nmaterials you need to make TMs at TM Machines![VAR 0114(0024)]
Speaking of which! Have you all been using the\nTM Machines?[VAR 0114(0024)]
I sure hope so, ’cause it’s pop quiz time![VAR 0114(0024)]
To create TMs, you need Pokémon materials and\none other thing. Anyone remember what that is?[VAR 0114(0024)]
LP
HP
Money
Looks like you’re already a TM Machine pro,\nnew kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
Whoa! Hold on there, new kid! Offering up HP to\ncreate TMs sounds like some kind of ritual or\r\nsomething! That’s not how it’s done![VAR 0114(0024)]
Close, new kid! Close! But don’t think that money\nmakes every little thing in the world go ’round![VAR 0114(0024)]
The correct answer is League Points—or LP\nfor short![VAR 0114(0024)]
You can give LP and Pokémon materials to a TM\nMachine to create TMs. But that’s not all!\c\nYou can also exchange Pokémon materials at a\nTM Machine to get LP![VAR 0114(0024)]
I recently heard about some shady individuals\ngetting LP illegally using a technique called...\r\nhacking? Or something like that.[VAR 0114(0024)]
I don’t want any of you getting involved in bad\nstuff like that. Got it?![VAR 0114(0024)]
Anyway, you can also add TMs that you want to\nmake to your watch list. This will let you keep an\r\neye on the materials you need to gather![VAR 0114(0024)]
In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
In order to make TMs, you need Pokémon\nmaterials![VAR 0114(0024)]
And if you want to get hold of lots of materials,\nyou’ll have to battle all kinds of Pokémon![VAR 0114(0024)]
Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we’re never gonna have the time...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Class is over for now! Take care, you little rascals![VAR 0114(0024)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : class_e_07.dat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Osu! This is our last class, but don’t let those\nenergy levels drop before we wrap things up![VAR 0114(0024)]
You’ve shown that you have more than enough\nknowledge to be superstrong battlers![VAR 0114(0024)]
I don’t know that I have much left to teach you...[VAR 0114(0024)]
but we can always aim for ever-greater heights![VAR 0114(0024)]
So today, I’m going to teach you about the rules\nof Link Battles![VAR 0114(0024)]
When two Trainers participate in Link Battles\ntogether, they can engage in either Single Battles\r\nor Double Battles with each other![VAR 0114(0024)]
And if you’re playing in a group of four, you can\nall battle each other in Multi Battles![VAR 0114(0024)]
Now, when you’re out having battles during your\nindependent study, you can use whatever number\r\nof Pokémon you like—and they can be any level![VAR 0114(0024)]
But, in Link Battles, there are special rules to\nkeep in mind.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Some of these special rules involve adjusting\nPokémon’s levels![VAR 0114(0024)]
Now, the [VAR FF00(0006)]No Restrictions [VAR FF00(0000)]rule set lets all Pokémon\nstay at their current level.\c\nIt lets Trainers use multiple Pokémon of the same\nspecies and multiples of the same held item, too![VAR 0114(0024)]
But if you choose to use [VAR FF00(0006)]Normal Rules[VAR FF00(0000)], all\nPokémon will be set to Lv. 50 for your battles—\r\nregardless of what level they actually are.[VAR 0114(0024)]
This even includes lower-level Pokémon. They’ll\nget a power boost to participate![VAR 0114(0024)]
Normal Rules let you use multiples of the same\nPokémon species and of the same held items too.[VAR 0114(0024)]
The great part about this rule set is that it lets\nany of your Pokémon participate—all they have\r\nto do is learn some good moves![VAR 0114(0024)]
Lastly, the rule set called [VAR FF00(0006)]Flat Rules[VAR FF00(0000)] mostly affects\nPokémon over Lv. 50. Such Pokémon will be set\r\nto Lv. 50 for the duration of the battle![VAR 0114(0024)]
The Flat Rules rule set is the one often used for\nofficial tournaments.[VAR 0114(0024)]
This rule set does NOT allow Trainers to use\nmultiple Pokémon of the same species or\r\nmultiples of the same held item![VAR 0114(0024)]
All right. Here’s a question for you![VAR 0114(0024)]
Which rule set should you pick if you want to use\na lower-level Pokémon and keep its level low?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Normal Rules
Flat Rules
Oooh, gotcha there! Normal Rules adjusts all\nPokémon to Lv. 50—even lower-level ones![VAR 0114(0024)]
That’s the one, new kid! Looks like you were\nlistening to the lesson![VAR 0114(0024)]
If you’ve got some clever strategy that you need\nto use a Lv. 5 Pokémon for, your best bet is to\r\nchoose the Flat Rules rule set![VAR 0114(0024)]
Of course, you can also choose No Restrictions if\nyou want to battle with any Pokémon you want—\r\nat any level and with any held item![VAR 0114(0024)]
That’s a pretty good rule set for when you want\nto battle freely with friends.[VAR 0114(0024)]
In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
Normal Rules adjusts all Pokémon to Lv. 50!\c\nFlat Rules lets you use lower-level Pokémon at\ntheir actual levels![VAR 0114(0024)]
I hope you’ll use these tips to have some exciting\nbattles with your friends![VAR 0114(0024)]
Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we truly are out of time...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Next class will be our final exam! Aim for a\nperfect score! Osu! Osu![VAR 0114(0024)]

Greetings, I am Hassel. I will be teaching this art\nclass. It is a pleasure to meet you all![VAR 0114(0012)]
Now, let me be candid for one moment.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I imagine that many of you will forget all that\nyou learned in this class once you graduate![VAR 0114(0012)]
After all, you don’t need even a basic\nunderstanding of artwork, much less a refined\r\nappreciation of beauty, for most exams or jobs.[VAR 0114(0012)]
So, is my class a waste of time for you, then?[VAR 0114(0012)]
I think not! At least, I certainly hope it isn’t![VAR 0114(0012)]
Think for a moment, all of you. What is beauty,\nanyway? What makes something beautiful?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Its shape and color
The eye of the beholder
I don’t know
Interesting... Thank you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
Oh, I don’t mean to suggest there’s a correct\nanswer to my query. The important thing is that\r\nyou all take time to think about it.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Think about why we might find beauty in a flower\nblooming on the side of the road, for example.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Question why the sky is a different shade of blue\nthan the ocean or why the leaves change color.\c\nPonder the windmills of Artazon and how they\nmove. Contemplate the chilling bite of the\r\nwaters of Cascarrafa.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m sure you will find that every little detail of\nyour lives will seem more vivid, more impactful,\r\nif you just take a moment to stop and think.[VAR 0114(0012)]
And I am certain that if you stop and truly\nappreciate the little beauties of this world...[VAR 0114(0012)]
it will help pull you through the days where your\nstudies have you exhausted or when work has\r\ndampened your spirits.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Ah, do pardon me for waxing philosophical.\nYou don’t need to understand all of that now.[VAR 0114(0012)]
To put it simply, it is true that one doesn’t need\nart to survive... But it certainly makes surviving\r\nmuch more enjoyable![VAR 0114(0012)]
It is my hope that this class will add even a little\nbit of color to your lives.[VAR 0114(0012)]
That’s all for today—next time, we’ll try a more\nhands-on approach to appreciating beauty![VAR 0114(0012)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : class_f_02.dat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hello, class! It is I, Hassel, yet again.[VAR 0114(0012)]
In our previous class, we discussed what beauty\nis...which might have been a little boring for you.[VAR 0114(0012)]
So today, I thought I would mix things up a little\nto pique your interest in art.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Allow me to introduce our special guest![VAR 0114(0012)]
Gib gibble.
This is Professor Gible, the assistant lecturer\nfor today.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Now then, Professor Gible. If you would be so\nkind as to Terastallize for us...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Glaaam!
As some of you may already know, a Pokémon\ncan Terastallize if you use a Tera Orb.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Normally, Professor Gible would be of the\nDragon type...[VAR 0114(0012)]
But by Terastallizing, it’s succeeded in changing\nits type![VAR 0114(0012)]
So, class...what type do these lovely, glistening\nflowers above Professor Gible’s head represent?[VAR 0114(0012)]
The Grass type
The Fire type
The Water type
[VAR BD06(0000)]Excellent, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nFull marks\r\nfor you![VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, not quite, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nActually,\r\nthe\r\ntype\r\nin\r\nquestion\r\nis\r\nweak\r\nto\r\nthe\r\nFire type![VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, not quite, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nActually,\r\nthe\r\ntype\r\nin\r\nquestion\r\nis\r\nstrong\r\nagainst\r\nthe\r\nWater type![VAR 0114(0012)]
These beautiful flowers blooming above\nProfessor Gible’s head show that it has now\r\nbecome a Grass type.[VAR 0114(0012)]
The shape of the [VAR FF00(0006)]Tera Jewel[VAR FF00(0000)] above a Pokémon’s\nhead depends on the Pokémon’s Tera Type.[VAR 0114(0012)]
To summarize! If an opponent’s Pokémon\nTerastallizes during battle...[VAR 0114(0012)]
observe a Pokémon’s Tera Jewel closely to see\nwhich type it has become![VAR 0114(0012)]
And choose effective moves accordingly![VAR 0114(0012)]
It is my sincere hope that today’s lecture will\nhelp you all achieve beautiful victories.[VAR 0114(0012)]
The Terastal phenomenon is indeed a fascinating\nand deep subject to discuss.[VAR 0114(0012)]
That is it for today, class! Thank you, Professor\nGible, for your help.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Glam-gib.

Hello, class! It is I, Hassel, yet again.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’ve been told that my previous lecture about\nthe Terastal phenomenon was very well received.\r\nThank you all for your kind words![VAR 0114(0012)]
In fact, Ms. Dendra specifically requested that\nI impart even more battle knowledge to\r\nmy students...[VAR 0114(0012)]
So, I have decided that today we will take\nanother look at how a Pokémon can Terastallize![VAR 0114(0012)]
Gib gibble.
And of course, here is Professor Gible to help us.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Now then, Professor Gible. If you would be so\nkind as to Terastallize for us...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Glaaam!
Now, what do we have here? Last class we saw\nGrass-type Terastallizing, but this time we have\r\nsomething of a different shape.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Observe, a Tera Jewel resembling a snowflake!\nIts dendritic shape is stunning to behold.[VAR 0114(0012)]
It’s a little chilly standing so close to it...[VAR 0114(0012)]
So, class... What Tera Type do you imagine this\njewel might represent?[VAR 0114(0012)]
The Water type
The Ice type
The Ghost type
[VAR BD06(0000)]Very close, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThis is\r\nwater...\r\nbut\r\nin\r\na\r\ndifferent state![VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Excellent, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nFull marks\r\nfor you![VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, not exactly, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nThough\r\nI\r\nsuppose\r\nthat\r\nis\r\nchilling\r\nin\r\nits\r\nown\r\nway, too![VAR 0114(0012)]
The reason there’s a snowflake shining above\nProfessor Gible’s head is simple—it is now\r\nan Ice type![VAR 0114(0012)]
And because Professor Gible is currently the\nIce type...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Ice-type moves would not be very effective\nagainst it. Keep in mind, usually they would\r\ndeal quadruple damage to Gible![VAR 0114(0012)]
Now, here’s some trivia about snowflakes:\nwhile snowflakes come in many different shapes\r\nand sizes, most are classified as hexagons![VAR 0114(0012)]
Just think of it... Snowflakes fall from the sky,\ntaking similar shapes without anyone saying\r\nthey must.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Do you not feel the great mystery of nature?\nThe beautiful enigma we live in?![VAR 0114(0012)]
*cough*\c\nAh, this is a bit of a tangent, but Mr. Jacq’s\nglasses are also hexagonal, aren’t they.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I almost forgot to mention that you can change\na Pokémon’s Tera Type at the [VAR FF00(0006)]Treasure Eatery[VAR FF00(0000)]\r\nlocated in Medali.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Though I must say the cook there is a little...\nprickly—you’ll need to get on her good side if\r\nyou want her help.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Now, come prepared for next class, because it is\ntime for your midterm examination!\c\nThank you for today, Professor Gible.[VAR 0114(0012)]

Hello, class! It is I, Hassel, yet again.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m pleased to say that everybody did very well\non the midterm exams.[VAR 0114(0012)]
As a reward for all of your hard work, we have\na special guest visiting us today![VAR 0114(0012)]
Now then, Brassie, please come in![VAR 0114(0012)]
Greetings![VAR 0114(002C)]
I am Brassius. I am an artist, and I focus\nexclusively on Grass-type Pokémon for my work.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Brassius here mainly creates three-dimensional\npieces, such as statues and the like.[VAR 0114(0012)]
One of his major works is the installation titled\nSurrendering Sunflora, found in Artazon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Many of you who’ve challenged the Artazon Gym\nare no doubt familiar with these sculptures.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Yes...I do recognize some faces among your\nstudents.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I hope you all understand how fortunate you are\nto be able to attend Hass’s classes.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Ol’ Hass is the man who saved me when I had\nlost all hope and given up on myself.[VAR 0114(0017)]
But he never gave up on me. I do not exaggerate\nwhen I say that he is my mentor in life![VAR 0114(0017)]
It is precisely thanks to Hass that I was able to\nestablish my current art style.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Ah, dear Brassie![VAR 0114(0012)]
I’ve nothing against reminiscing about old times,\nbut today, I hope you will guide this class in a\r\nway only you can![VAR 0114(0012)]
Of course![VAR 0114(0017)]
Let’s see... Ah, why don’t we discuss what Hass\nmentioned—Surrendering Sunflora?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Can anyone here tell what my mood was when I\ncrafted its detached expression?[VAR 0114(0017)]
A happy mood
A sad mood
An angry mood
No, no, no... Completely and utterly wrong![VAR 0114(0017)]
When I made that sculpture, I had surrendered\nall hope. I was prepared to give up everything.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I had resolved to give up my life as an artist if\nthat piece did not receive proper recognition.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Hence the name Surrendering Sunflora?[VAR 0114(0012)]
That’s exactly it, Hass![VAR 0114(0017)]
When I started out as an artist, I experienced\nmany hardships. I even became deathly ill and\r\nfell into a slump that drove me to desperation.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I began worrying only about what would sell.\nI was concerned only with fame and fortune...[VAR 0114(0017)]
But all of my pieces during this time had no\ndepth. They were all shallow trash![VAR 0114(0017)]
It was then that I met Hass. He helped me realize\nhow petty I was being. I’ll spare you the details...\r\nbut in the end I was able to leave all that behind![VAR 0114(0017)]
And that is also when I crafted the Sunflora![VAR 0114(0017)]
Remarkable! Even I did not know the full story\nuntil now![VAR 0114(0012)]
This kind of thing is hard to tell someone,\nespecially when they are so close to you.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Now, I don’t doubt that you adolescents will\noften find your heads crowded with worries.[VAR 0114(0017)]
My advice to you is simple. Be honest with\nyourself, and do whatever your heart desires.\r\n...So long as you don’t cause trouble, that is.[VAR 0114(0017)]
That is all from me.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I must admit I am beginning to feel a bit\nembarrassed, so I bid you farewell, Hass!\r\nAnd farewell to your pupils as well![VAR 0114(0017)]
Oh Brassie, I can’t believe it... Such a wonderful...\nclass... Thank...[VAR 0114(0012)]
THANGYU SO MUBCH![VAR 0114(0012)]
BWUUUH huh huh huh huh!\nHUUUH huh hoi hoi hoi...[VAR 0114(0012)]

Hello, class! It is I, Hassel, yet again.[VAR 0114(0012)]
First, allow me to apologize for losing my\ncomposure during our last class...[VAR 0114(0012)]
I was so touched by Brassius’s story that I simply\ncouldn’t contain my emotions. I’m sorry for\r\nmaking such a scene.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I certainly got a very stern talking-to from\nMs. Tyme after that class, yes...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Anyway, let us shift gears and dive into the\nmaterial for today’s class![VAR 0114(0012)]
Now, have any of you heard of the Ten Sights\nof Paldea?[VAR 0114(0012)]
As the name would imply, they are ten sights in\nPaldea that are considered particularly beautiful.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Among them, I would say that the[VAR FF00(0006)] Grand Olive[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Orchard[VAR FF00(0000)] is likely the most accessible.[VAR 0114(0012)]
You can see field after field of olive trees from\nthe hill on the way to Cortondo.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Two waterfalls are also counted among these\nten sights—[VAR FF00(0006)]Fury Falls[VAR FF00(0000)] and [VAR FF00(0006)]Casseroya Falls[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
Then there’s the peak of Glaseado Mountain,\nknown as [VAR FF00(0006)]Paldea’s Highest Peak[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
There’s another cliff on Glaseado Mountain that’s\nnamed after its rather unique shape.[VAR 0114(0012)]
So, let me ask you, my students![VAR 0114(0012)]
What is the name of the three-pronged cliff on\nGlaseado Mountain? No need to grasp at straws![VAR 0114(0012)]
Glaseado’s Grasp
Glaseado’s Reach
Glaseado’s Run
[VAR BD06(0000)]Exactly! It looks like a hand taking hold of\nsomething, doesn’t it, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0012)]
A very good guess! I’d think something reaching\nwould stretch out farther, though.[VAR 0114(0012)]
A unique take! But that sort of name would\nusually apply to a slope, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(0012)]
The three-pronged cliff on Glaseado Mountain\nis in fact known as [VAR FF00(0006)]Glaseado’s Grasp[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
Though its shape is far too stubby to be that\nof a human hand. I imagine someone thought it\r\nlooked like a Pokémon hand grabbing something.[VAR 0114(0012)]
There’s also the mountains in Area Three of the\nEast Province, where you can get a good look at\r\nLevincia. It’s particularly gorgeous at night![VAR 0114(0012)]
In fact, the view is so brilliant, it is known as the\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Million Volt Skyline[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
I hear it’s quite a hotspot for dates—and\ndeservedly so for having such a romantic view![VAR 0114(0012)]
I imagine it’s...what do the kids say these days...\na very, ahem, “fleek selfie spot”?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Of course, you may feel that not all ten sights live\nup to their grandiose names. How often do we\r\nvisit some tourist spot only to be disappointed?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Not to say that you shouldn’t visit them, only\nthat you should keep your hopes in check.[VAR 0114(0012)]
The important thing is to go yourself and see\nthem with your own two eyes.[VAR 0114(0012)]
And sometimes, a disappointing experience can\nbe worthwhile in its own way. Take a chance![VAR 0114(0012)]
Well, that’s it for today, class. Thank you for\nyour attention![VAR 0114(0012)]

Hello, class! It is I, Hassel, yet again.[VAR 0114(0012)]
My, my, how time flies, as they say![VAR 0114(0012)]
Indeed, our time together has certainly flown by.\nIt’s hard to believe that this is our last class.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Now, our topics for today may feel somewhat\nunrelated to art.[VAR 0114(0012)]
But there is absolutely no set definition as to\nwhat art should be![VAR 0114(0012)]
Therefore, let us carry on with the discussion and\nsee where it takes us![VAR 0114(0012)]
There are two things I wish to focus on today—\nRibbons...and marks![VAR 0114(0012)]
Both Ribbons and marks are special honors that\ncapture a Pokémon’s qualities.[VAR 0114(0012)]
There will be times when your Pokémon gives\nmaximum effort or has a noteworthy experience.[VAR 0114(0012)]
In recognition of its feats and accomplishments,\nit can be given a Ribbon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
To give an example, if you manage to become\nincredibly close to a Pokémon, it may be granted\r\nthe Best Friends Ribbon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Incidentally, there is a person in Cascarrafa who\ncan give your Pokémon a Best Friends Ribbon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Marks, on the other hand, are mostly found on\nwild Pokémon when you meet them for the\r\nfirst time.[VAR 0114(0012)]
They can symbolize the character of a Pokémon,\nsuch as with the Rowdy Mark or the Vigor Mark.[VAR 0114(0012)]
It’s completely up to luck whether you’ll run into\na Pokémon with these marks![VAR 0114(0012)]
So if you’re able to catch a Pokémon with a\nmark, rejoice at your outstanding fortune![VAR 0114(0012)]
Does anyone know what special thing you can do\nwith Pokémon that have Ribbons or marks?[VAR 0114(0012)]
You can exchange Ribbons!
You can show them off!
You can change their title!
Ah, unfortunately, you can’t transfer Ribbons or\nmarks from one Pokémon to another, nor can you\r\ntrade them with other people’s Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Well, yes, indeed you can show them off, but\nsurely that’s not the extent of your interest, is it?[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Wonderful, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Your\nknowledge\r\nis\r\nimpressive.[VAR 0114(0012)]
The correct answer is that Pokémon with Ribbons\nor marks can be given titles.[VAR 0114(0012)]
What’s more, they can be sent into battle\ndisplaying a title of your choosing![VAR 0114(0012)]
For example, you could send out a Gible with\na Best Friends Ribbon by declaring...\r\n“Go! Gible the Great Friend!”[VAR 0114(0012)]
And while I know I just said that marks are\ngenerally found already on Pokémon when you\r\nmeet them for the first time...[VAR 0114(0012)]
it seems that more recently, Pokémon can be\nawarded certain marks based on their efforts.[VAR 0114(0012)]
These are marks such as the Gourmand Mark,\nthe Itemfinder Mark, the Partner Mark, and so on.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Perhaps it might be fun to try to work out how to\nget each mark using its name as a clue?[VAR 0114(0012)]
Well, that just about wraps up our last class![VAR 0114(0012)]
Next is the final exam. Please review our material\nclosely so that you pass on your first try![VAR 0114(0012)]

The time we shared has left a mark that I will\ntreasure, I promise you.[VAR 0114(0012)]
And it is my sincere wish that all of you go on to\neven greater, more prosperous futures.[VAR 0114(0012)]
And that’s that! Good work, everyone! You can\nreceive your results from the front desk.[VAR 0114(0012)]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I see we have some energetic young ones in our\nclass this time around.[VAR 0114(002C)]
You may call me Mr. Saguaro.\c\nYour time here with me will be spent obtaining\nknowledge and skills indispensable for daily life.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Many of you have left the care of your parents to\nlive here on your own in the academy dormitory.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I pray that the knowledge I impart to you will\nimprove the quality of your lives and the\r\nnecessities thereof—food, clothing, and shelter.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Of those three categories, I assume the most\npressing and interesting for you all is food.[VAR 0114(0029)]
When you eat sandwiches on your picnics, the HP\nof your party Pokémon will be restored.\c\nYou will also gain something called [VAR FF00(0006)]Meal Powers[VAR FF00(0000)],\nwhich can provide all manner of benefits.[VAR 0114(0029)]
For example, these powers can make Pokémon\neasier to catch or increase the Exp. Points that\r\nyour Pokémon receive.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I think you will also find that the breadth of these\neffects can be expanded by crafting sandwiches\r\nof superb flavor.[VAR 0114(0029)]
What’s more, there is a certain something that is\nparticularly important if we wish to receive Meal\r\nPowers with even more helpful effects.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Let me see... M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nTell me—what must you keep in mind to receive\neven more helpful Meal Powers?[VAR 0114(0029)]
My choice of fillings and condiments
How fast I can prepare the food
I have to remember to put my heart into it!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Perfectly correct, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nPerhaps you were already aware of this fact from\nhaving helped your family with cooking at home?[VAR 0114(0029)]
That is...incorrect. I pray that you all put more\nemphasis on doing things well when cooking\r\nrather than simply rushing to finish quickly.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Ha! That is an interesting take. Though not\nexactly what I was looking for, I suppose you are\r\ncorrect, in a sense.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Your choice of ingredients—including both fillings\nand condiments—is an important factor in gaining\r\neven more helpful Meal Powers.[VAR 0114(0029)]
For example, using sweet ingredients in your\nsandwiches may help you gain Egg Power.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Including numerous bitter ingredients, on the\nother hand, can gain you Item Drop Power.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Learning to aim for specific effects when crafting\nsandwiches will almost certainly make your\r\nculinary endeavors more enjoyable.\c\nPlease be aware, however, that you can also\nreceive Meal Powers by eating at restaurants.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I must say that I would feel the utmost joy if you\nall learned much here in my class and came to\r\nbetter understand home economics.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Our time together has come to an end for today.\nI bid you all farewell.[VAR 0114(0029)]

Put away your phones. It is time to begin class.[VAR 0114(0029)]
In our last class, I believe we talked about the\neffects you can get from food on your picnics.[VAR 0114(0029)]
You can receive Meal Powers and even restore\nHP for all the Pokémon in your party. It is a truly\r\nconvenient means of healing your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Unfortunately, as I’m sure you are aware, it is not\nsuited for use in battles—when you cannot make\r\nfood—or when you wish to restore HP quickly.[VAR 0114(0029)]
In times such as those, you should make use of\nhealing items—such as [VAR FF00(0006)]Potions[VAR FF00(0000)], which you can\r\npurchase from Poké Marts or the school store.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Healing items are immediately effective and can\nbe used anytime that you can open your Bag.\r\nThey are, however, consumed after one use.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Potions restore 20 HP, Super Potions restore\n60 HP, and Hyper Potions restore 120 HP.[VAR 0114(0029)]
The pricier the item, the more HP it will restore.\nKeep in mind how much money you have when\r\nyou are stocking up on these items.[VAR 0114(0029)]
However, unforeseen happenings are an\ninextricable part of traveling from place to place.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Imagine, if you will, the following scenario: you\nfind yourself with injured Pokémon, but you have\r\nno Potions, you are out of sandwich ingredients,\r\nand there are no Pokémon Centers nearby.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Tell me, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nWhat should you search for when in a perilous\nsituation with no way to heal your Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0029)]
A place with water
A teacher
Items on the ground
Would you hope to use the water to prepare a\nbracing meal perhaps?\c\nAs I mentioned, you have no ingredients, so even\nwith water, you would not be able to make food.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Ah, yes. Of course, if a teacher were nearby, they\ncould likely be of assistance.\c\nHowever, you must not assume that a grown up\nwill always be nearby to rush to your aid.[VAR 0114(0029)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Perfectly correct, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nI see\r\nyou\r\nare\r\nwell-learned\r\nin\r\nsurvival techniques.[VAR 0114(0029)]
If you see something shiny on the ground, it is\nactually an item that has been dropped there!\c\nYou may be able to find a restorative item, such\nas an Oran Berry or a Potion, in this way.[VAR 0114(0029)]
You can use the [VAR FF00(0006)]R Button[VAR FF00(0000)] to send out your\nPokémon to pick up such items as well.[VAR 0114(0029)]
And then there are Berries, of course.\c\nBerries, by the way, aren’t like items from shops—\nif you let your Pokémon hold one, it will decide\r\non its own when to eat the Berry during battle.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Letting your Pokémon decide this timing for itself\ncan be quite interesting![VAR 0114(0029)]
At any rate, if you find yourself in need of\nhealing, I suggest that you look around for\r\nshining items on the ground.[VAR 0114(0029)]
If you can’t find such items, there are other\nmethods you may employ for healing your—\c\nAh, but I see the bell demands that topic wait.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Our time together has come to an end for today.\nI bid you all farewell.[VAR 0114(0029)]

Put away your phones. It is time to begin class.[VAR 0114(0029)]
In my last class, I taught about HP restoration.[VAR 0114(0029)]
However, after class, I was asked by several of\nyou about [VAR FF00(0006)]Power Points[VAR FF00(0000)], commonly known as [VAR FF00(0006)]PP[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
When a Pokémon loses all of its HP, it faints and\ncan no longer battle![VAR 0114(0029)]
What, then, happens to a Pokémon when it loses\nall of its PP?[VAR 0114(0029)]
It can’t use moves
It won’t listen to its Trainer
All of its stats get lowered
[VAR BD06(0000)]Perfectly correct, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nPerhaps\r\nyou\r\nknow\r\nthis\r\nfrom\r\nfirsthand experience?[VAR 0114(0029)]
That would certainly be a dangerous situation,\nbut that is not the correct answer.\c\nWhether a Pokémon listens to its Trainer depends\non the number of Gym Badges the Trainer has.[VAR 0114(0029)]
That would certainly be a dangerous situation,\nbut that is not the correct answer.\c\nThat is not the sort of power we are talking\nabout when we talk of Power Points.[VAR 0114(0029)]
When a Pokémon runs out of PP, it can no longer\nuse its moves.[VAR 0114(0029)]
However, each move has its own store of PP, so\nyou can mitigate PP loss by using a variety of\r\nmoves rather than just one move repeatedly.[VAR 0114(0029)]
If a Pokémon loses all PP for all of its moves, it\nwill only be able to use Struggle—an action that\r\nalso damages the Pokémon that uses it.[VAR 0114(0029)]
In order to avoid this predicament, PP can be\nrestored at Pokémon Centers along with HP.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Items such as Ethers and Max Ethers can also be\nused to restore PP. Be careful not to confuse\r\nPotions with Ethers in the heat of battle![VAR 0114(0029)]
However, Ethers are not sold at shops, so you\nshould use them judiciously if you find them.[VAR 0114(0029)]
The stronger the move, the lower its maximum PP.\c\nDo not waste uses of these moves unless you wish\nto quickly run out of PP. It is important to find\r\nbalance in a Pokémon’s set of moves.[VAR 0114(0029)]
As you can see, HP isn’t the only thing you must\nkeep an eye on while adventuring with Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I hope that you will all take care to ensure that\nyour partner Pokémon can perform at their best\r\nas you each engage in the Treasure Hunt.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Our time together has come to an end for today.\nOur next meeting will be an examination day.\r\nBe sure to review well in preparation.[VAR 0114(0029)]

I feel honored to see that the knowledge and\nskills indispensable for daily life have taken root\r\nin all of you.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I trust that you will all work just as hard on your\nlife skills in this second half of our course as well.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Let us now turn our attention to the topic of the\nday, which was inspired by a question I received\r\non the subject of Meal Powers.[VAR 0114(0029)]
The student who asked this question is a young\nman who enjoys the culinary arts.[VAR 0114(0029)]
He tells me that he regularly researches culinary\ntechniques on his own and pays careful attention\r\nto the ingredients he uses.[VAR 0114(0029)]
He also spends day and night studying all aspects\nof the culinary arts.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Yet despite this, he is baffled by his inability to\nincrease the effectiveness of his Meal Powers.[VAR 0114(0029)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So tell me, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)],\nsince\r\nyou\r\ndid\r\nquite\r\nwell\r\non\r\nyour\r\nmidterm\r\nexam...[VAR 0114(0029)]
What should Ar—ahem, this young man—do to\nincrease the effectiveness of his Meal Powers?[VAR 0114(0029)]
He should make food more often
He should make food with other people
Ar...ven?
The culinary arts are not so easily grasped.\nSimply engaging in them more often will not\r\nnecessarily reward you with success.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Perfectly correct. I see that you are\nknowledgeable about the culinary arts.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Ahem... I cannot disclose the identity of this\ncertain male student who enjoys the culinary arts.\r\nIt may very well be Arven, but it may not be![VAR 0114(0029)]
To increase the effectiveness of Meal Powers,\nyour sandwiches must be filled with many\r\ndifferent ingredients.[VAR 0114(0029)]
For a single person, this may prove difficult. But\nif you prepare a sandwich with others, you will\r\nbe able to handle a larger serving of bread.[VAR 0114(0029)]
With a larger base to start with, it becomes quite\nsimple to add more ingredients to your sandwich.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Which, in turn, makes it possible to receive Meal\nPowers of increased effectiveness.[VAR 0114(0029)]
This applies more broadly as well. When dealing\nwith a difficult issue, working with others to solve\r\nthat issue may be the best course of action.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I am sure that Arven will likewise work with\nfriends to craft his sandwiches in the future.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Ahem... The identity of the male student is a\nmatter of privacy, so I would ask that you do not\r\npry too deeply.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Our time together has come to an end for today.\nI bid you all farewell.[VAR 0114(0029)]

Put away your phones. It is time to begin class.[VAR 0114(0029)]
While you’re out performing fieldwork with one\nof your Pokémon walking alongside you...[VAR 0114(0029)]
have you ever noticed changes in its coloration?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Now I don’t mean that it suddenly becomes a\nShiny Pokémon or any nonsense like that.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I am speaking of it becoming filthy![VAR 0114(0029)]
Pokémon battle! They get hurt by moves used\nagainst them![VAR 0114(0029)]
They get battered by wind and rain! They get\ncovered in sand and mud![VAR 0114(0029)]
They get, in a word, filthy![VAR 0114(0029)]
I have seen many a Trainer walking about with\ntheir adorable little Pokémon without addressing\r\nthis issue. It is deplorable.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Let me ask this question of someone who I am\nsure would not tolerate such shameful conduct.\r\nAh yes, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
What should you do if your Pokémon is dirty?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Clean it up
Pat it on the head
Nothing
Perfectly correct! I knew I could count on you to\nprovide me with such an answer.[VAR 0114(0029)]
While patting your Pokémon on the head to\nexpress appreciation for its hard work would\r\nmake for an adorable moment, that would not\r\nclean it of its filth![VAR 0114(0029)]
I suppose, in time, filth accumulated from rain\nand mud may well fall of its own accord...but I\r\nnever expected such an answer from you.[VAR 0114(0029)]
When your Pokémon are dirty, clean them!\nThis is, of course, simply common sense.[VAR 0114(0029)]
While you are having a picnic, you can approach\nthe Pokémon on your team and perform a\r\nvariety of actions.[VAR 0114(0029)]
One such action is putting them through what I\nlike to call the “Pokémon Wash”... In other words,\r\nyou are able to clean them up![VAR 0114(0029)]
You start by getting your sponge lathered up with\nsoapy bubbles as you gently and carefully scrub\r\nyour Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Once your Pokémon is nice and covered in\nsoapy bubbles...[VAR 0114(0029)]
the bubbles will encapsulate the filth, then you\nsimply wash it away with a spray of water![VAR 0114(0029)]
This will get your Pokémon clean and shining\nbright as a Tera Jewel![VAR 0114(0029)]
It is certainly quite a bit of work, but this will\nalso restore HP and cure status conditions.[VAR 0114(0029)]
However, some Pokémon may have parts of their\nbodies that they don’t want scrubbed or that\r\nthey would rather not get wet.\c\nBe sure to keep this in mind when cleaning your\nPokémon.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Now, the most important point that I must\nmention is that some Pokémon LIKE to be dirty.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Though I will contradict myself by saying this,\nplease do remember that cleaning your Pokémon\r\nis not always the kind thing to do.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Our time together has come to an end for today.\nI bid you all farewell.[VAR 0114(0029)]

Put away your phones. It is time to begin our last\nclass together.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Home economics is the study of life’s necessities,\nbut looking back on our time together, I realize\r\nthat I focused almost entirely on food.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I hope it is not too late to shift to a discussion of\nclothing—another necessity—in our last class.[VAR 0114(0029)]
As I’m sure you are aware, our academy has an\nair of freedom about it.[VAR 0114(0029)]
We provide uniforms for each season to\naccommodate the diverse climate of Paldea.\c\nHowever, students are free to wear whichever\nstyle they wish whenever they please.[VAR 0114(0029)]
You should all have received four sets of tops\nand bottoms—one each for spring, summer, fall,\r\nand winter—when the academy accepted you.[VAR 0114(0029)]
If, by chance, you were not aware of this, you\nmay wish to peruse your wardrobe.[VAR 0114(0029)]
As long as you wear our school uniform, the rest\nof your ensemble need not be school-issued.[VAR 0114(0029)]
This includes your bag or your hat, if you choose\nto wear one. You are even free to style your hair\r\nhowever you wish.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Mr. Salvatore’s hairstyle, for example, would\nalmost certainly have been against school rules\r\nwhen I was a boy.[VAR 0114(0029)]
That reminds me...[VAR 0114(0029)]
There is one more thing you all like to decorate,\nwhich—I must say—I find quite charming.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Our classroom desks?
Our dorm rooms?
Our Rotom Phones?
No, not that. I speak of something smaller and far\nmore adorable...\c\nMore importantly, your desk is not different or\ncustomized in the slightest![VAR 0114(0029)]
No, not that. I speak of something smaller and far\nmore adorable...\c\nMore importantly, how you decorate the interior\nof your dorm rooms is none of my business![VAR 0114(0029)]
Perfectly correct! That’s the adorable little thing\nI was speaking of! Ohhh, it interests me so![VAR 0114(0029)]
I must admit that I am fascinated by Rotom\nPhones and how to customize them![VAR 0114(0029)]
What’s that...? How very intriguing!\c\nSo there’s a shop called Delibird Presents, where\nyou can purchase cases for your Rotom Phones![VAR 0114(0029)]
I thank you for that useful bit of information...[VAR 0114(0029)]
I shall have to go myself first thing tomorrow to\nget an adorable case of my own liking.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Forgive me... I seem to have gotten a little\ncarried away with this small talk.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Ahem. As this class known as home economics\nnears its end, I offer these final words to you who\r\nhave been honing everyday life skills with me.[VAR 0114(0029)]
My field of study is not so decisive as the likes\nof mathematics, for instance, where test scores\r\nmight play a part in deciding your future.[VAR 0114(0029)]
However, as you go on to cook for yourselves,\nto take care of your Pokémon, to decide what to\r\nwear in the morning when you awaken...[VAR 0114(0029)]
I would be honored if what I have taught you\nserves to smoothen out and enrich your lives,\r\neven if only a little.\c\nThis sentiment was imparted to me by Mr. Hassel\nand his particular outlook on such matters.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for\nseeing this class through to the end.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Our time together has come to a close for today.\nPrepare to do your best on our final exam.[VAR 0114(0029)]

The time for answering questions has come to an\nend. Please stop writing.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I...made the questions a little easier than I’d\nplanned to, as a way of saying thank you for\r\ninforming me about Rotom Phone cases.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I trust that you all gave this exam everything you\nhad so that you will not have to retake it.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Please remember to ask for your scores at the\nfront desk before leaving for the day.[VAR 0114(0029)]

I’m so excited for you![VAR 0114(002B)]
Still, you might want to cool your engines before\nyou go racing out the door.[VAR 0114(002B)]

Why not take this opportunity to walk about with\nthese little ones and get to know them?[VAR 0114(002B)]

[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)] seems to have taken quite\na\r\nliking\r\nto\r\nyou,\r\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
This is your first Pokémon, yes? Please raise it\nwith love and care.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And of course, be sure to keep it tucked safely\ninside a Poké Ball.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]... I can’t believe you\nactually\r\nchose [VAR 0101(0001)]...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I mean, like, way to make the perfect choice\nfor you! You two make such a good combo![VAR 0114(0004)]
Can I choose one of these Pokémon too,\nDirector Clavell?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, but...did you not receive a Pokémon when\nyou entered the academy, Miss Nemona?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Not back then, no! I had other Pokémon I was\nfocused on raising at the time.[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]But now I want to raise a new Pokémon alongside\n[VAR 0100(0000)] while [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she raises h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser\r\nown\r\nnew partner![VAR 0114(0004)]
Indeed, a rather splendid idea.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]If you wish to raise one of these Pokémon on\nequal footing with M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nhere,\r\nI shall\r\nbe\r\nmore\r\nthan\r\nhappy\r\nto\r\nallow it.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Yesss![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Since [VAR 0100(0000)] chose\n[VAR 0101(0001)],\r\nI’ll\r\ngo\r\nfor\r\nthis\r\nlittle one![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Nice to meet you, [VAR 0101(0002)]! Welcome to\nthe team![VAR 0114(0004)]
Spurrrrrr!
Crawww!
Pump-pomp!
All right, then![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now that we’ve chosen our Pokémon, we HAVE\nto battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ll be waiting for you down at the beach.\nCome join me when you’re ready![VAR 0114(0004)]
As you may have noticed, Miss Nemona is a tad\noverly fond of Pokémon battling.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But I do hope you’ll join her for a battle. It will\nhelp you get to know your own Pokémon as well.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Miss Nemona was hoping you would join her at\nthe beach, wasn’t she? She’d be ever so happy\r\nif you agreed to a battle with her.[VAR 0114(000A)]

Over here![VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyone can be a Pokémon Trainer as long as\nthey have Pokémon by their side![VAR 0114(0004)]
And it’s our duty as Trainers to help our Pokémon\ngrow stronger through battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So, you ready to battle me,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oye! Don’t get cold feet on me now! I wanna see\nwhat you’ve got![VAR 0114(0004)]
Perfecto! I’m so excited! For this battle,\nI think I’ll use—[VAR 0114(0004)]
Miss Nemona.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I trust you remember that M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nis\r\nwholly\r\ninexperienced\r\nin\r\nPokémon battling?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Heh, whoops... Good call, Director.\c\nI was about to send out one of my usual partners\nright off the bat...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I guess I’ll take this chance to try out my new\nbuddy instead![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]C’mon, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Let’s have us\na\r\nfruitful\r\nbattle![VAR 0114(0004)]
Look at you, winning your first battle ever!\nYou’ve got even more potential than I thought!\r\nYou’re gonna be a strong Trainer for sure![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hey, if you can battle like that on your first try,\nyou definitely have what it takes to be a Trainer![VAR 0114(0004)]
But now I want to try a different strategy!\nLet’s go again—just one more battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)] and h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser\n[VAR 0101(0001)]\r\nare\r\nsurely\r\nweary\r\nalready\r\nfrom\r\nthat\r\nlast battle.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Ah, sorry! I got kinda caught up in all the\nexcitement...[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’m really sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nSame\r\nto\r\nyour\r\n[VAR 0101(0001)], too.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Don’t worry about it
Let’s battle again soon!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Heh... All right!\nThanks, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, definitely! We’ll definitely battle more![VAR 0114(0004)]
You two seem to be becoming fast friends,\nthough you’ve only just met.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Can I count on you to take your new schoolmate\nhere under your wing, Miss Nemona?\c\nI’m sure [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she can learn a great deal from a\nChampion-ranked Trainer, such as yourself.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You bet, sir![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, that reminds me! Since you’re new to training\nPokémon, there’s an app you definitely need![VAR 0114(0004)]
You have a smartphone, right? Lemme see it\nfor a sec.[VAR 0114(0004)]
The [VAR FF00(0006)]Pokédex app[VAR FF00(0000)] was added to your\nRotom Phone!
The Pokédex will automatically register any\nPokémon you catch.[VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s a must-have for Pokémon Trainers!\c\nIt’s a super handy app! Our homeroom teacher,\nMr. Jacq, actually made it himself![VAR 0114(0004)]
Back in my day, we used ordinary paper and\nhandwritten notes to compile our Pokédexes.\r\nIt’s quite the age we live in now.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Oof! Filling out a Pokédex by hand? I can’t even\nimagine how much work that would take![VAR 0114(0004)]
Ohoho... No, I suppose you can’t.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Yet no matter how much the times may change,\nthe wonder of meeting new Pokémon never does.\r\nThat is a truly timeless pleasure.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And the more Pokémon that you encounter, the\nmore you’ll find yourself growing and changing.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I hope you will both work hard toward the goal\nof completing your own Pokédexes.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Now, Miss Nemona, I do still have a few matters\nto discuss with your parents.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Could I depend on you to see M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nto\r\nthe academy?\c\nYou would be doing me quite the favor.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Of course! Leave it to me![VAR 0114(0004)]
Then I leave h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer in your capable hands.[VAR 0114(000A)]
All right, little one. It’s time you and I were\non our way.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Sprrr.
Fwaaa!
Omp...
Maybe I oughta make a little more time to work\non my Pokédex along with all my battling...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh! Right![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Speaking of Pokédexes,\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\nyou’ve\r\nprobably\r\nnever\r\ncaught\r\na\r\nwild\r\nPokémon, right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ll show you the ropes before I take you to the\nacademy. Come with me![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Do be careful on the way to school,\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]

Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(002B)]
I hear that Nemona here will be taking you\nto school?[VAR 0114(002B)]
That’s right, ma’am. Leave it to me![VAR 0114(0004)]
So you’ve already managed to make a friend![VAR 0114(002B)]
And I read about all the wonderful teachers\nyou’ll have looking after you at the school.\c\nPlus so many handy facilities you can use as much\nas you like![VAR 0114(002B)]
Add in your new friend, Nemona, and it sounds\nlike your school life is shaping up to be fantastic![VAR 0114(002B)]
Now, you’ll be staying in the school dorms, so I\nwant you to promise me you’ll eat proper meals.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Here’s a bit of spending money to start off with.\nI also packed a lunch for your first day![VAR 0114(002B)]
Oh! And maybe you’d better take these, too.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Use them on that precious little partner of yours,\nshould it get hurt in battle.[VAR 0114(002B)]
I know every day in your new life is going to be\nfull of exciting experiences, far from home.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Just try to savor them all—the good times and\nthe hard times, too![VAR 0114(002B)]
But if you ever want to come back home, you\nknow your bed is always ready for you.[VAR 0114(002B)]
Oh, all right then! You two had better be off,\nI suppose. Take care on the way to school![VAR 0114(002B)]
Your mother’s so nice, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh! But I was going to teach you how to catch\nwild Pokémon! C’mon, vamos![VAR 0114(0004)]
This way![VAR 0114(0004)]

All right! This here is Poco Path![VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s the path that leads to adventure for you\nand me!\c\nOut here, things are different than in town.\nYou’re gonna see wild Pokémon out and about.\r\nThey’ll be on the path and in the grass and such![VAR 0114(0004)]
Get too close to one, and you’ll have to battle.\nBut you’ve got [VAR 0101(0001)] for that, right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
And if you want to try to catch a Pokémon,\nyou gotta use...[VAR 0114(0004)]
a good ol’ [VAR FF00(0006)]Poké Ball[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ve got tons. Have a few![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oink, oink!
Oooh, what luck![VAR 0114(0004)]

Nice! Defeating Pokémon in battle will help\n[VAR 0101(0001)] grow and get stronger![VAR 0114(0004)]
Next time, try throwing a Poké Ball when a\nPokémon’s riiight on the tip of being defeated.\r\nYou’ll have a decent chance at catching it then![VAR 0114(0004)]
Good call! If you know you can’t win a battle,\ntactical retreats are what’s up![VAR 0114(0004)]
When you’ve got the edge, though, you can try\ncatching the wild Pokémon in a Poké Ball![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hala! That was awesome! You caught the very\nfirst Pokémon you went for![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m crummy when it comes to actually catching\nPokémon. Maybe YOU should give ME tips![VAR 0114(0004)]
Aw, you lost! Were you hesitating a little when it\ncame time to attack?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Sometimes seeing how strong you are will make\nwild Pokémon accept you. So don’t be shy—\r\nbattle hard and throw those Poké Balls![VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyway, have some more Poké Balls just in case.\nNot every catch works out![VAR 0114(0004)]
Weaken the Pokémon, then throw the Poké Ball!\nRemember that, and you’ll be fine![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now go battle those wild Pokémon and catch\nsome of ’em![VAR 0114(0004)]
Let’s meet back up at that lighthouse over there!\nYou can see our school from the top![VAR 0114(0004)]
If your Pokémon are getting tired out, I can heal\n’em for ya![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, and if you get real good at catching\nPokémon, gimme some advice! I’m not great at\r\nthe actual “throw the Poké Ball” part.[VAR 0114(0004)]

Let me see. So far you’ve caught—[VAR 0114(0004)]
Guh-GYAOHHH![VAR 0114(001D)]
Whoa! What was that?![VAR 0114(0004)]
Go-ohhh...[VAR 0114(001D)]
I’ve never heard that kind of cry before! Could\nbe some strong Pokémon or something![VAR 0114(0004)]
I say we find whatever made that cry! Let’s take a\nlook around, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nJust be careful—there’s a kinda unsafe cave not\nfar from here, so steer clear!\c\nAnd I know your Rotom Phone can help keep you\nsafe, but watch your step by these cliffs anyway![VAR 0114(0004)]

I’m fine!
I’m managing!
Thank goodness. I was really worried![VAR 0114(0004)]
If you’d gotten hurt because I said we should go\nlooking for whatever made that cry...[VAR 0114(0004)]
No, never mind that! Right now we’ve gotta\nfocus on getting you back up here![VAR 0114(0004)]
[~ 7]

Maybe it used up all its power?\c\nWhat is this Pokémon, anyway? It kinda looks\nlike a Cyclizar, but I’ve never seen one quite\r\nlike this before...[VAR 0114(0004)]
And now it looks so different from a minute ago.\nYou think it’s OK?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Hard to say
I don’t know
[VAR BD06(0000)]You can’t tell either, huh,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, all that aside, I’m seriously glad to have\nyou back up here in one piece![VAR 0114(0004)]
Let’s exchange numbers so we can get in touch if\nwe somehow get separated again![VAR 0114(0004)]
And here—this’ll let you teach your Pokémon a\nmove to help it battle stronger opponents![VAR 0114(0004)]
Think before you use it, though! TMs can only be\nused once.[VAR 0114(0004)]
You know...that battle down there was really\nsomething.[VAR 0114(0004)]
You and this fella looked perfectly in sync\nfacing down that Houndoom![VAR 0114(0004)]
What?! You didn’t even tell it what to do?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I guess it’s not like you’re this Pokémon’s\nTrainer yet, huh...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh good! Looks like it perked up a little![VAR 0114(0004)]
Do you think this fella was the one making that\nmysterious cry we heard before?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Giaos...
Oh man, oh man, oh man! The more I look at this\nPokémon, the more mysterious it seems![VAR 0114(0004)]
If you do become its Trainer, you gotta let me\nbattle against it![VAR 0114(0004)]
You’ve both been through enough for a minute!\nI think we better take a breather.\c\nLet’s just get to the lighthouse—that’ll be a good\nspot to relax.[VAR 0114(0004)]

I’m not talking to you two. You can shove off.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Wait, I know you... Aren’t you Arven?\nYou’re enrolled in the humanities track, right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
And aren’t you the son of that Pokémon\nresearcher—Professor Sada?[VAR 0114(0004)]
And aren’t you the son of that Pokémon\nresearcher—Professor Turo?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Doesn’t matter who my mom is![VAR 0114(0006)]
Doesn’t matter who my dad is![VAR 0114(0006)]
The real issue here is what in the world this\nPokémon is doing out here!\c\nAnd what is with this form it’s in?![VAR 0114(0006)]
I met it at the bottom of this cliff...
It saved me from a tight spot...
[VAR BD06(0000)]See, we heard this strange cry, and we tried to\ninvestigate, but [VAR 0100(0000)] fell\r\noff\r\na cliff...[VAR 0114(0004)]
That Pokémon saved h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer, but it seems like it\nwore itself out in the process. It got kinda...\r\nslumpy afterward.[VAR 0114(0004)]
But you shoulda seen it before! It looked totally\ndifferent—it was unbelievably strong![VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, yeah. As it should be. But it can’t fight\nwhile it’s like this.[VAR 0114(0006)]
The form [VAR 0101(0001)] takes in battle... That’s its\ntrue form.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR 0101(0001)]? Is that this Pokémon’s name?\nHow’d you know it?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Agiagias!
You can’t go in the lab. It’s locked.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I don’t remember ever seeing you around. But\ngiven the uniform...you go to the academy too,\r\ndo you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR 0101(0001)] isn’t the sort of Pokémon that any\nold Trainer can hope to command. It’s special.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Special how? What sort of Pokémon is it?[VAR 0114(0004)]
You think you’re up to ordering [VAR 0101(0001)]\naround? Then how ’bout I test your worthiness?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Heh! Well, look at you—quite the little go-getter![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’m saying I want to test you. You can’t just leave\nme hanging here![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ve been feeling all out of sorts, so I’m gonna\nuse this battle to blast these doldrums away![VAR 0114(0006)]
Wow, [VAR 0100(0000)]! That was awesome![VAR 0114(0004)]
I guess I wasn’t ever going to stand a chance\nusing some Pokémon I’d only just caught...[VAR 0114(0006)]

Yeah, you’re in some serious trouble if you can’t\neven beat someone like me.\c\nI’d be worried about my future, if I were you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But if you really think you can take [VAR 0101(0001)]\noff my hands for me...you’ll need this.[VAR 0114(0006)]
It’s the Poké Ball that brute’s been kept in.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[~ 32]
So why’d YOU have it?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyway, that thing’s your problem now, not mine.\nGood luck.[VAR 0114(0006)]
What? Oye! Can you not hear me or something?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Fine, be that way! But you better actually show\nup for school![VAR 0114(0004)]
What a weirdo...[VAR 0114(0004)]
That Arven guy definitely knows more than he’s\nletting on.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Next time, he and I are battling! I’m gonna wring\nsome answers outta him![VAR 0114(0004)]
But oh, right—we gotta climb the lighthouse!\nCan’t wait to show you the view of our school![VAR 0114(0004)]

Oyeee! Up here! Come on![VAR 0114(0004)]
Look, [VAR 0100(0000)]! That’s Mesagoza![VAR 0114(0004)]
And that huge building with the Poké Ball on it\nis our school![VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s gonna be so great having you in the same\nclass, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’m looking forward to it!
But all that schoolwork...
Right? I can’t wait to get back. We’re gonna get\nto learn so much...and battle so, so, SO much![VAR 0114(0004)]
Don’t think of it as schoolwork—think of it as\ntons of chances to learn about Pokémon battling![VAR 0114(0004)]
Isn’t it awesome what you can see from up here?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Mountains! Forests! Grasslands! Beautiful nature\nstuff, as far as the eye can see![VAR 0114(0004)]
And you know what’s waiting for you all over\nthese natural spaces? Tons of Pokémon![VAR 0114(0004)]
Consider this me officially telling you:\nwelcome to Paldea![VAR 0114(0004)]

But anyway, like you can see, it’s kind of a hike\nto get to school from here.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Let’s make it to Los Platos for starters.\nThat’s right on the way![VAR 0114(0004)]
Vamos! C’mon![VAR 0114(0004)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : common_0210.dat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Oye, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Over here![VAR 0114(0004)]
This here’s a Pokémon Center![VAR 0114(0004)]
You can come here to take care of a lot of things\nrelated to your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0004)]
But I’ll leave the explanations to the pros here.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Happy to be of service—and welcome to the\nPokémon Center!
I’m here to keep everyone’s Pokémon healthy.
And this to my right is the Technical Machine\nMachine—TM Machine for short!
It’s your ticket to making TMs, which you can use\nto teach moves to your Pokémon.
You’ll need to pay in [VAR FF00(0006)]LP[VAR FF00(0000)] and supply the machine\nwith [VAR FF00(0006)]materials[VAR FF00(0000)] that Pokémon drop.
LP comes in handy both at these machines and at\nstores! I’ve got a lot—here, have some![VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh yeah, and some of these too![VAR 0114(0004)]
You received lots of Pokémon [VAR FF00(0008)]materials [VAR FF00(0000)]from\nNemona!
Here on my left is the Poké Mart counter! You\ncan buy things like Poké Balls and Potions.
Hello! We accept payment both in cash and in\n[VAR FF00(0006)]LP[VAR FF00(0000)]—[VAR FF00(0006)]League Points[VAR FF00(0000)], that is. One LP is worth 1!
And at the Union Circle, you can connect\nwith other Trainers to find yourself some\r\nadventuring companions!
Come visit us at the Pokémon Center anytime\nyou need any help!
We will. Thanks![VAR 0114(0004)]
Remember: “Had a rough adventure?\nGet to the Pokémon Center!”\c\nSometimes you have to know this sort of stuff for\nquizzes at school.[VAR 0114(0004)]
But mnemonics help out! Here’s another one:\n“[VAR FF00(0006)]‘R’ you ready?[VAR FF00(0000)] Then [VAR FF00(0006)]Let’s Go[VAR FF00(0000)]!”\c\nGoofy, sure, but it helps you remember you can\n[VAR FF00(0006)]send your lead Pokémon out with the R Button[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
That way, you can have the Pokémon that’s\nwalking with you go pick up items lying around\r\nor go battle on its own or other stuff like that![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now, time to go. Once we leave Los Platos, we’ll\nhit the best-known spot in the South Province’s\r\nArea One: the massive hill on the way to school!\c\nYou’ll usually find Trainers there who are just\nitching to battle. Good luck![VAR 0114(0004)]

Oyeee! [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
[~ 2]
Didja battle some Trainers on the hill? Bet your\nPokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare getting stronger![VAR 0114(0004)]
How about you show me how much you [VAR 1101(00FD,0303)]twoall have\nlearned...in a battle?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Sure thing!
I don’t know...
All right! Nothing like having a friend around![VAR 0114(0004)]
If you’re not sure, all the more reason to give it\na shot! A nice battle will help us get to know\r\neach other better, too![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Let’s have\nus a\r\nfruitful\r\nbattle![VAR 0114(0004)]
Amazing! Look at you, taking on a [VAR FF00(0006)]Terastallized[VAR FF00(0000)]\nopponent and winning, no problem![VAR 0114(0004)]
Come to think of it, you can’t Terastallize your\nPokémon yet, huh?\c\nDon’t worry—I’ll get you taken care of![VAR 0114(0004)]
You’re so good with Pokémon battles, I forget\nhow new you are to this stuff sometimes![VAR 0114(0004)]
I guess the hill wore you out a bit, huh? Still,\neven if I did take the win this time, your moves\r\nweren’t bad. Not bad at all![VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyway, it was fun to battle you! Here, have\nsome Revives as thanks![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now, Mesagoza’s waiting just past this gate!\nAt last, the city where our school is![VAR 0114(0004)]
There’s a ton of hills and stairs and stuff in the\ncity, so I’m gonna take a quick breather and then\r\ncatch up with you soon![VAR 0114(0004)]
[~ 17]

All right, here I am! We finally made it, huh?[VAR 0114(0004)]
This is Mesagoza! The biggest city in Paldea![VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s been a big trade hub since a long time ago.\c\nLots of folks come here to learn about advances\nin technology and all kinds of other stuff.[VAR 0114(0004)]
There’s a hair salon where you can change your\nlook, plus places with tasty food and fixings...[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]What do you want to see first,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
The hair salon!
Tasty food!
Oh, you’re a fashionista, are you?\c\nOr maybe you just want a practical ’do that won’t\nget in your eyes when you’re battling![VAR 0114(0004)]
Hah! I didn’t have you pegged for a big eater!\c\nBut that’s smart. You can’t battle well with a\ngrowling tummy, right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, and speaking of battling...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I wanna be sure you’ll be able to Terastallize\nyour Pokémon too, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
There’s a few things that gotta get done for that\nto happen, but I’ll take care of ’em![VAR 0114(0004)]
Meanwhile, you just have fun looking around the\ncity a bit![VAR 0114(0004)]
There’s so much to do—grab a bite, buy some\naccessories to spice up your uniform...[VAR 0114(0004)]
If you want my personal recommendation, you’ve\ngotta see Delibird Presents! They sell handy\r\nitems for Pokémon to hold.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Once you’ve seen your fill, we can meet up again\nin front of the school!\c\nJust...be ready. The stairs up to school are\nno joke.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Later, then! Get pumped for some Terastallizing![VAR 0114(0004)]

Don’t you get it?! If you join Team Star, you can\nshine as bright as anybody![VAR 0114(002D)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(002C)]
Seriously, what’s with you? Don’t you wanna\nburn bright with awesome friends like us?[VAR 0114(002E)]
...Not really.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Look—we’ve got a quota we’re supposed to fill\nfor new members, so just sign up already![VAR 0114(002D)]
Um... I’d rather not...[VAR 0114(002C)]
Help her out
Walk away
Huh? You want in on this, too?[VAR 0114(002E)]
If you’re here to sign up, we’ll get to you next!\nWe’ve nearly got this one in the bag![VAR 0114(002E)]
We’re Team Star, kid. We burn so bright, it hurts\nto look at us! But you knew that, right?[VAR 0114(002D)]
So you know exactly who you’re messing with,\nand you’re still coming at us with that attitude?\c\nYou’re scary, kid. If you joined Team Star, you’d\nbe looking down from the top in no time![VAR 0114(002D)]
Ugh, another ignorant little nobody...\c\nHere I’m finally part of Team Star, and still I get\nno respect? I gotta work my way up the ranks...[VAR 0114(002D)]
Hey—we can’t just let something like this slide!\c\nThe honor of our team’s on the line, so we’ve got\nno real choice but to battle, yeah?[VAR 0114(002E)]
That’s true! You keep watch on that little four-\neyes over there![VAR 0114(002D)]
I’ll make sure this fresh-faced nobody ends up\nseeing stars![VAR 0114(002D)]
Urk, why’s a nobody like you so good at battling,\nanyway? That’s just not right...[VAR 0114(002D)]
No way, [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she beat you?![VAR 0114(002E)]
Does that mean I gotta battle this kid now since\nI’m higher up Team Star’s ranks?![VAR 0114(002E)]
Pero bueno! What do you think you’re doing?![VAR 0114(0004)]
Ugh! It’s that student council dweeb![VAR 0114(002D)]
She’s gonna report us if we don’t book it...[VAR 0114(002E)]
I can’t believe you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
You don’t have to go find randos to battle! You’ll\nhave all the battles you’ll ever need...with me![VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s really not what happened...
It was those Team Star punks...
Wait—THEY picked a fight with YOU? Wow, I\nread that way wrong! Sorry![VAR 0114(0004)]
I get it now. You two have got Team Star written\nall over you for sure!\c\nI bet you were trying to pressure people into\nsigning up again, weren’t you?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Ah, hi. We weren’t...not doing that.[VAR 0114(002E)]
Well, that explains it.\c\nAs head of the student council, stopping this\ntype of nonsense would normally be MY job...[VAR 0114(0004)]
But this is also the perfect chance for you to try\nmy amazing and ultra-rare gift to you![VAR 0114(0004)]
With this Tera Orb, you can [VAR FF00(0006)]Terastallize[VAR FF00(0000)] your\nPokémon during battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
Let’s see. After it Terastallizes, I’m pretty sure\nyour [VAR 0101(0001)] will beee...[VAR 1302(0002,0000)][VAR 0103(0002)] type![VAR 0114(0004)]
Normally you’ve gotta take special classes to be\nable to get one of these Tera Orbs, but I put in\r\na good word for you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Now, time to give it a whirl! You’ll learn to use it\nfaster in battle than if I just explain it to you![VAR 0114(0004)]
Wait, what? You want this kid to practice whaling\non us with h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser Tera Pokémon, is that it?[VAR 0114(002E)]
Got a problem? You wanna battle me instead?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Hnnng... Never mind! I’ll take my chances with\nthe new kid![VAR 0114(002E)]
Then take your places, and...battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Nice, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You pulled\noff\r\nTerastallizing\r\nno problem![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Nice, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You didn’t\neven\r\nhave\r\nto\r\nbother\r\nTerastallizing\r\nyour Pokémon![VAR 0114(0004)]
Moves of your Pokémon’s Tera Type will hit even\nharder when it’s Terastallized, y’know![VAR 0114(0004)]
Sometimes you’ll find a Pokémon whose Tera\nType is totally different from its usual type. That\r\ndifference can open up your strategic options!\c\nGotta charge your Tera Orb at a Pokémon Center\nafter every use by healing up your team, though.[VAR 0114(0004)]
W-well... I’ll be on my merry way, then, yeah?\nHasta la vistaaarrr! ☆[VAR 0114(002E)]
Me, too! Hasta la vistar! ☆[VAR 0114(002D)]
So, yeah—Team Star is basically a group of\nstudents that like to kick up trouble.[VAR 0114(0004)]
They hardly ever show up to class, and when they\nget together in groups, they’re a real headache.\c\nEven the teachers don’t know what to do with\n’em, from what I hear...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Um...’scuse me![VAR 0114(002C)]
I...uh... I just... Well, thanks.[VAR 0114(002C)]
So, yeah... See you around.[VAR 0114(002C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Awww, look at you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nAlready\r\nbecoming\r\na big\r\nhero\r\naround campus![VAR 0114(0004)]
I don’t think I’ve seen that girl around. Maybe\nshe’s a new transfer, like you...\c\nThat Eevee bag, though! Love that fluff![VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyway, seems like the trouble’s died down, so\nwe’d better book it up to school!\c\nGet ready to climb the worst staircase in\nthe world![VAR 0114(0004)]

You can sign up for all kinds of classes at the\ndesk behind me, and those halls off to the sides\r\nlead to all different parts of the school.[VAR 0114(0004)]
It’s totally big enough to let loose and battle in\nhere, but for some reason, they banned Pokémon\r\nbattling in the main entrance...[VAR 0114(0004)]

We had a blast!
It was tough!
I imagine Miss Nemona’s high spirits helped with\nthat. She’s a true asset to our fine academy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Oh dear, was it really? I suppose Miss Nemona\nmust have led you on quite the adventure...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Not that I was expecting any less from our\nChampion-ranked student council president.\r\nReliable as ever, Miss Nemona.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Well, I know how to look after my friends!\nRight, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh! But speaking of which...we saw some of\nthose Team Star kids in town, Director![VAR 0114(0004)]
You did?! Where?![VAR 0114(000A)]
It was down the stairs from the front gates. They\nwere hassling this kid with an Eevee backpack...[VAR 0114(0004)]
That is quite the news. Are they still to be found\nout there?[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Actually, [VAR 0100(0000)] flexed\non ’em\r\nand ran\r\n’em off.[VAR 0114(0004)]

Of course it’s a fine thing to try to help a fellow\nstudent, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nBut you might wish to show a bit of restraint as\nyou find your feet here at our academy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And, Miss Nemona, do remember that the\nschool’s staff is here to resolve any such troubles.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Uh... Right! Yes sir, Director![VAR 0114(0004)]
A child with an Eevee backpack, you say...\nI suppose that might have been Miss Penny.\r\nI’m relieved to hear she’s come to class, at least.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Ah, and Miss Nemona? If you’d be so good, do\nreport to Mr. Jacq about this Team Star business.\c\nAs your homeroom teacher, he should be kept\napprised of all such goings-on.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You got it, sir![VAR 0114(0004)]
Ah, but look at the time. You two had better\nhurry along—classes will be starting soon.[VAR 0114(000A)]

What’s your favorite thing about Pokémon?
I like battling with Pokémon
I like collecting Pokémon
I like playing with my Pokémon
I like everything about Pokémon!
Really? Awesome! I’m totally the same!
Does anyone else have a question for their\nnew classmate?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Me! I have a question![VAR 0114(0004)]
You went to all the trouble of enrolling here, so\nspill, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0004)]
What do you hope to get out of it? You must\nhave some kind of dream, right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I want to complete the Pokédex
I want to be a strong Trainer
I don’t actually know
I’m glad I got you set up with that Pokédex app if\nyou like collecting that much![VAR 0114(0004)]
You will be! Oh, I just know it! You and me—\nwe’re going to get so strong battling together![VAR 0114(0004)]
Fair, I get it! The possibilities are endless, right?\nWho can decide![VAR 0114(0004)]
Well, thank you for telling us a bit about\nyourself, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI’m Mr. Jacq. I teach biology here at the\nacademy, and I’m also your homeroom teacher.[VAR 0114(002A)]

All right, you ragamuffins. Be nice and friendly\nto our new classmate![VAR 0114(002A)]
We will, Mr. Jacq!
Get to know the academy campus by exploring a\nbit on your own!
Yo, new kid! Glad to have you!
When class is in session, we tend to be on our\nbest behavior. But our best still isn’t that good!
Wh-what, you want to talk to me?!
Thanks for answering my question earlier!
Welcome to the academy!
Looking for Nemona? She got called to the staff\nroom just now.

I ask each of you to set out and travel the world\nin search of your own treasure.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You have all learned much within the walls of our\nfine academy...[VAR 0114(000A)]
But now it is time to turn your eyes upon the\nwider world and deepen your understanding.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Explore Paldea’s abundant nature, soak in its\nrich culture...[VAR 0114(000A)]
discover the Pokémon that live here...[VAR 0114(000A)]
and get to know the people, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]

You could try to beat Pokémon Gyms, you could\nhelp out people in need... You could hunt for\r\nreal capital-T treasure if you wanted, even![VAR 0114(0004)]
There’s stuff we’d never learn sitting in a\nclassroom, y’know? This is our chance to learn it![VAR 0114(0004)]

No need for concern, you two. I’m not angry in\nthe slightest.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I merely called you all here to discuss your fine\nachievements in this year’s Treasure Hunt.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You shut down the professor’s time machine\nand thus prevented the ancient Pokémon from\r\nrunning rampant across Paldea.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You shut down the professor’s time machine and\nthus prevented the Pokémon from the future from\r\nrunning rampant across Paldea.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Your actions were truly outstanding in every\nregard, and I couldn’t be prouder of you all.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Though your decision to enter a strictly off-limits\narea was admittedly...regrettable.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Heh. You’ve got us there.[VAR 0114(0004)]
However. Since this was necessary to protect\nPaldea and its precious ecosystems, I am willing\r\nto overlook that particular point.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Phew... So we’re not getting raked over the coals\nafter all.[VAR 0114(0008)]

While your own vested interests in such a venture\nare more than apparent, Miss Nemona, I think\r\nit’s a fine idea![VAR 0114(000A)]
But please understand that a large-scale event\nwill be quite beyond us. We’ve many other\r\nschool activities to keep an eye on, after all...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Pardon my intrusion. I couldn’t help but overhear.[VAR 0114(002C)]
The Pokémon League will, of course, happily\nlend a hand in organizing this contest.[VAR 0114(0011)]

Well, well! A most kind offer, Chairwoman Geeta.[VAR 0114(000A)]

Though that’s not to say only the youth have\npromise when it comes to Pokémon battles.[VAR 0114(0011)]
A former Gym Leader... The developer of the\nPokédex app... This academy clearly counts many\r\nskilled Trainers of Pokémon among its staff.[VAR 0114(0011)]
As such, my suggestion is as follows...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Students AND staff should compete for the title\nof strongest Trainer at the academy![VAR 0114(0011)]
Whoaaa! We’d get to battle the TEACHERS!\nYou’d compete too, right, Primera?![VAR 0114(0004)]
Is that even allowed? The chairwoman’s not part\nof the academy, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Aaactually, I think she’s the chairwoman of the\nschool board as well as of the Pokémon League...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Wait, for real? I mean, I knew she was on another\nlevel, but...wow.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Thank you for the invitation, Champion Nemona.\c\nI would gladly take up your kind offer to compete\nalongside you all, but...[VAR 0114(0011)]
I’m afraid my schedule is already packed tight\nwith work that I simply must attend to.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Awww! Can’t you free up some time somehow?[VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Well... I suppose I might be able to participate if\nChampion [VAR 0100(0000)] would agree\r\nto\r\nlend\r\nme\r\na\r\nhand\r\nwith\r\nmy work...?[VAR 0114(0011)]

Where should I start?
[VAR BD06(0000)]Excellent answer. Much obliged, Champion\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
To get straight to it, I would like you to go out\nand inspect Paldea’s various Gyms in my stead.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Are they fulfilling their duties as beacons of\nstrength and inspiration for all those aiming\r\nto achieve Champion Rank?\c\nOr has their brilliance started to fade?[VAR 0114(0011)]
To find this out, I ask that you bring your full\nmight as Champion to bear against each of the\r\nGym Leaders and test their prowess in battle.[VAR 0114(0011)]
They are all Trainers of exceptional talent,\nhandpicked by me personally.\c\nI do not expect you’ll find any cracks in their\narmor, but...well. Consider it a formality.[VAR 0114(0011)]
This will also provide the perfect stage for your\nfirst appearance as a new Champion.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Since all the Gym Leaders will still be expecting\nme to carry out the inspection, I imagine they’ll\r\nhave mustered their full strength.\c\nI daresay they might be more of a challenge than\nwhen you faced them before.[VAR 0114(0011)]
You get to have all-out battles with the Gym\nLeaders?! Man, I’m jealous...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Now then, on to another crucial matter.\c\nI’d like to discuss with Penny here how to patch\nthe weaknesses in our League Point system.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Um. But...there’s a bunch of anime I’ve missed\nthat I was just...gonna...binge...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Thank you in advance for your willing and\neager cooperation.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Gah—I mean...I’ll d-do it. I’ll help. Let me help.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Excellent. We’ll leave you all to it, then. Come\nnow, Penny.[VAR 0114(0011)]
This is awesome, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nShow this inspection thing who’s boss so that\nLa Primera can join our tournament, OK?\c\nAnd enjoy taking another swing at the Gym\ngauntlet while you’re at it![VAR 0114(0004)]
I’ll take care of filling out the forms and other\nadministrative stuff so the ball gets rolling on the\r\ntournament in the meantime![VAR 0114(0004)]
I say, it’s wonderful to see you all showing such\ninitiative. You each have a critical role to play.\c\nPenny assisting the League, our new Champion\ninspecting Gyms, Nemona arranging the event...\r\nGive it your best, everyone![VAR 0114(000A)]

Sorry, I got heated there. Don’t worry, though—\nyou aren’t the one who struck that nerve.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Oh well. I was just thinkin’ I’d like to see you\nagain anyway. Guess this is just how fate has it![VAR 0114(001B)]
If we’re doin’ this, let’s do it. Ready to show me\nhow strong all those adventures made you?[VAR 0114(001B)]
You ready to show me how strong you are\nnow, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(001B)]
Now THAT’s the spirit! C’mon, let’s put on a\nkiller show![VAR 0114(001B)]
No? Then what’d you come here for? Come back\nwhen you’re ready to go![VAR 0114(001B)]
Hey now! You’re gonna need at least two\nPokémon in battlin’ shape to take me on![VAR 0114(001B)]

It feels like just yesterday that you were here for\nyour Gym Test.[VAR 0114(001B)]
Now you’re all Championed up and out doin’\nerrands for La Primera herself![VAR 0114(001B)]
Tell ya somethin’: You get to be my age?\nTime starts passin’ you by fast.[VAR 0114(001B)]
But that sentimental style’s not worth my while!\nTime to kick a rhyme and hit the flow—let’s go![VAR 0114(001B)]

Hahaha! Wasn’t expectin’ you to rattle me\nTHAT much![VAR 0114(001B)]
You caught me off guard just like Shadow Sneak![VAR 0114(001B)]
Sorry for callin’ you a rookie. Hope we’re good.[VAR 0114(001B)]
I just wanted to prove the strength of Ghost\ntypes to Geeta, but I guess I got carried away.[VAR 0114(001B)]
You’re the real deal, my friend. I can guarantee\nthat.[VAR 0114(001B)]
From here on out, Ryme’s got your back.[VAR 0114(001B)]
If you run into any vexin’ Trainers or hexin’\nspecters, you just give me a call.[VAR 0114(001B)]

You here to hit the slopes? I don’t recall the snow\nbeing too good today...[VAR 0114(001A)]

Aw, for real...? I’ve got something important to\nbe dealing with in a bit, y’know...[VAR 0114(001A)]

Oh, I see... You’re here to cover for Geeta.[VAR 0114(001A)]
So, your dream came true. You’re Champion\nRank now. You must be so happy.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Oh, my bad... That sounded a lot more sarcastic\nthan I’d intended.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Don’t get me wrong. I really think it’s amazing.\nJust... It’s complicated for me—that’s all.[VAR 0114(001A)]

These League-mandated inspections happen\na few times a year.[VAR 0114(001A)]
If we don’t show we’re up for the job, we’ll lose\nour positions as Gym Leaders.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Geeta always says it’s just a formality, but...[VAR 0114(001A)]
I’ve already had to give up on being a pro\nsnowboarder. If she takes away the talents\r\nI still have to show, then what’ll be left?[VAR 0114(001A)]
Sorry, didn’t mean to bring the temperature\ndown. It’s simple enough, really.[VAR 0114(001A)]
All I need to do is make sure the power of my\nPokémon chills you to the bone![VAR 0114(001A)]
Man, Geeta must really have it out for me.\nSending someone there’s no way I could beat...[VAR 0114(001A)]
Still, no regrets on my part. I gave it everything\nI had.[VAR 0114(001A)]
I hit you full force, and I lost anyway. It made me\nfeel...frustrated.[VAR 0114(001A)]
It makes me want to become stronger as a Gym\nLeader. Put more of myself into it.[VAR 0114(001A)]
I’d thought my passion had frozen over, but...\nyou’ve rekindled it for me.\c\nThanks, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(001A)]

Oh...yeah?

Though I believe I can spare my legs today, as we\nare sure to create my greatest masterpiece yet—\r\neven if I do not alight from above![VAR 0114(0017)]
But I digress. We are both artists, are we not?\nWe have no further use for words now.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I assume you are ready? Let our collaborative\nwork of art begin![VAR 0114(0017)]
Seeing you in the midst of battle—you are like a\nunique gradient, subtly changing hues![VAR 0114(0017)]
Riotous and yet gentle! Such contrast... I lack the\nwords to express it. My hat goes off to you![VAR 0114(0017)]
My battles with you are truly a gift. Each time, I\nam made to remember how I felt so long ago\r\nwhen I first ventured into this world of art.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Ah, I almost forgot. You were here for the Gym\ninspection in the Top Champion’s stead, correct?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Well, that is of no consequence. Report on my\nGym here as you see fit.[VAR 0114(0017)]

We older folk tend to prefer the latter, o’ course,\nbut this ol’ man himself finds that a bit dull.[VAR 0114(0018)]
Rivers flow into the ocean. That water then climbs\nup into the clouds an’ becomes rain.[VAR 0114(0018)]

You really looked like you were enjoying yourself\nwhen you tried my sweet treats, too.\c\nPeople like that always have great potential.[VAR 0114(0016)]

How many Gyms had you been to when you first\ncame here to mine? Was it your first?[VAR 0114(0016)]
The Cortondo Gym is close to the academy, so\nmany young Trainers just starting out like to come\r\nhere first.[VAR 0114(0016)]
With that in mind, La Primera asks me to go soft\non Trainers—like a nice sponge cake.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I feel sad for my sweet little bugs, though, since\nthat means they quite often lose their battles.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Hehe. But opportunities like this get me excited\nbecause I can finally show my true skill.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Allow me to knead you into submission![VAR 0114(0016)]
That was quite the battle. I must say that your\nskill rivals that of even La Primera.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Ah! How sweet it is to battle without holding\nback—even if I end up losing![VAR 0114(0016)]

There’s scenery you’ll never even notice if you\nstick to flat, well-trodden paths.[VAR 0114(0015)]
It’ll do me good to admire talent that soars as\nhigh as yours from time to time.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Well, if the boss says I should do so, I’ll do so.\nShe won’t catch me doing it for fun, though.[VAR 0114(0015)]

It’s so cool that La Primera’s gonna make a guest\nappearance, thanks to your hard work![VAR 0114(0004)]
I wish I didn’t have my hands full with all the\nbehind-the-scenes admin stuff.\c\nI won’t even get to do any battling myself...[VAR 0114(0004)]
But I’ll seize the chance to do some objective\nresearch into what makes YOU so good![VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyway, let’s get going. I’ll meet you at the\nfront desk in the entrance hall! No stalling![VAR 0114(0004)]

There you are, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0004)]
You’ve gotta go through the application process\nwith a staffer before you can actually participate\r\nin the tournament![VAR 0114(0004)]
Ready for that explanation now, mister![VAR 0114(0004)]
All right. The rules of the Academy Ace\nTournament are as follows:\c\nAny student or faculty member of the academy\nmay enter. Your opponents will be random, and\r\nonly winners will advance to the next round!
Opponents will be matched by lottery, and the\nlottery is run by the people in charge.
That means you’ll have no idea who you’ll be\nfacing until you meet them on the battle court!
Winners, as I said, will get to advance to the\nnext round.
But lose once, and you’re knocked out—no more\nbattles for you after that.
The last Trainer standing—the only person to win\nall their matches—will be deemed the best of all,\r\nthe academy’s ace!
Thanks very much![VAR 0114(0004)]
We hashed out the tournament rules with help\nfrom Director Clavell.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Based on the number of entrants so far, you’d\nprobably have to win four times to take it all![VAR 0114(0004)]
Don’t forget you might go up against the faculty,\ntoo. They’re tough stuff...so good luck and go be\r\neven tougher![VAR 0114(0004)]
The only person allowed to beat you is me![VAR 0114(0004)]
Please talk to me when you’re ready to take part.

[VAR BD06(0000)]Champion [VAR 0100(0000)] will\nbe facing...
Arven, from class 2-G!
You’ve got to be kidding me. Up against my little\nChampion buddy right from the first round...[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So how about it, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Bet\nyou’re\r\nsurprised\r\nto\r\nsee\r\nme\r\nin\r\nthis\r\ntournament, right?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Heheh... Yeah, that’s right! That dumbfounded\nexpression is what I wanted to see![VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait, you actually thought I would sign up for\nthis thing? Boy, I guess you really do get me...\r\nNo wonder we’re best buds![VAR 0114(0006)]
See, when we went down into Area Zero, it really\ndrove home for me how I need to get stronger.[VAR 0114(0006)]
So I’ve been off doing some special super-\nserious training with Mabosstiff and my team![VAR 0114(0006)]
If we ever end up in trouble again, I want to be\nthere fighting beside you—on the same level.[VAR 0114(0006)]
So today I’m here to WIN! Even if it might only\nbe by a stroke of luck![VAR 0114(0006)]
Get a taste of this! Arven’s here with some spicy\nnew flavor for you![VAR 0114(0006)]
And the winner of this first-round battle is...\nChampion [VAR 0100(0000)]!
Whoo! All right! That professor’s kid put up a\nheck of a fight!
What a spicy start! And that’s only the first match!
Phew, the strength of a Champion is legit! It hurts\nto lose, but I’m proud of you, little buddy![VAR 0114(0006)]
Maybe I should think about going around to all\nthose Gyms myself sometime...[VAR 0114(0006)]
You’d better try just as hard as I would’ve in\nround two, for me![VAR 0114(0006)]

Hello, hello, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(002A)]
I hear you went out on your Treasure Hunt and\nwound up becoming a Champion.[VAR 0114(002A)]
That’s quite the achievement![VAR 0114(002A)]
I guess I’m the homeroom teacher for two\nChampion Rank students now.[VAR 0114(002A)]
I won’t lie—I’m feeling a wee bit of pressure\nhere![VAR 0114(002A)]
I’ve got to work hard so my students don’t\noutshine me too much, huh?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Well, then! Let’s get started, shall we?[VAR 0114(002A)]
Here’s hoping I do OK![VAR 0114(002A)]

You’re more fit for the teaching profession than I\nam with that boundless confidence of yours![VAR 0114(002A)]
Mr. Jacq! Did I hear you correctly just now?![VAR 0114(000A)]
Uh-oh. Uh... Hi, Director. Are you angry with me?\nHehe...[VAR 0114(002A)]

The matchup for this battle will be Champion\n[VAR 0100(0000)] versus...
Dendra, the battle studies teacher!
Osu! New kid![VAR 0114(0024)]

There’s no better place for me to show off\nmy strengths![VAR 0114(0024)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]New kid—no, Champion\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0024)]
As a teacher, I feel like it’s my duty to lead my\nstudents to success.[VAR 0114(0024)]
BUT! Since I AM the battle studies teacher here,\nI can’t very well lose in a battle, can I?![VAR 0114(0024)]
So don’t expect me to go easy on you! I’m going\nto give it all I’ve got![VAR 0114(0024)]
And the winner of this third-round battle is...\nChampion [VAR 0100(0000)]!
No way! I got crushed![VAR 0114(0024)]
But I still got something great out of this battle!\nThis was a massive chance for me to grow![VAR 0114(0024)]
You may be surprised to hear this, but we adults\nare still learning every day, too.[VAR 0114(0024)]
That’s why we’re always harping on you kids to\nstudy! Turns out we actually DO know what we’re\r\ntalking about![VAR 0114(0024)]
Thanks for the battle! Keep aiming for the top in\nthis tournament, and don’t forget...\r\nOsu! Osu! Osu![VAR 0114(0024)]

It’s Champion [VAR 0100(0000)] up against...
a special guest joining our tournament, the Top\nChampion, Geeta!
Good day, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
I had a feeling I would meet you in the finals.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Honed strength against honed strength...[VAR 0114(0011)]
Such a clash is what captures the crowd...and\nmakes their hearts race.[VAR 0114(0011)]
This is extremely close to what I would call my\nideal world.[VAR 0114(0011)]
As the chairperson for both the Pokémon League\nand the academy...[VAR 0114(0011)]
I find this situation to be incredibly satisfying.[VAR 0114(0011)]
Now, if we both push each other to greater\nheights, we will achieve greater synergy.[VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Come, Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nOur battle\r\nwill\r\ninspire\r\nall\r\nthose\r\nwho\r\nwatch\r\nus\r\ntoday![VAR 0114(0011)]

I would like to extend my thanks to everyone who\nmade this extraordinary tournament possible.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Each and every Trainer demonstrated beautifully\nthe bond they share with their Pokémon.\r\nI couldn’t take my eyes off any of the matches![VAR 0114(000A)]
“Taking lessons from tradition—growing stronger\nand greater.”[VAR 0114(000A)]
“Leading the way into the future—while valuing\nour individuality.”[VAR 0114(000A)]
That is our motto at Naranja Academy... And the\ntournament truly lived up to our ideals![VAR 0114(000A)]
That is our motto at Uva Academy... And the\ntournament truly lived up to our ideals![VAR 0114(000A)]
Now, I’m aware my speeches tend to get a little,\nshall we say, overlong, so I’ll wrap it up there.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I now turn the floor over to our special guest,\nChairwoman Geeta.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The friendly rivalry of the Trainers... The cheering\nand encouragement from the crowd...[VAR 0114(0011)]
I feel like these are the perfect ingredients for\nthe academy—[VAR 0114(0011)]
no, for the whole Paldea region to become more\nlively and energized![VAR 0114(0011)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Champion [VAR 0100(0000)] was far\nstronger\r\ntoday\r\nthan\r\nwhen\r\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she\r\ntook\r\nthe\r\nPokémon\r\nLeague’s\r\nfinal test...[VAR 0114(0011)]
It is clear that [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she strives to become better every\nday, even after reaching such an esteemed rank![VAR 0114(0011)]
It is my sincere hope that all Paldea’s people will\nbe inspired not just by h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer but by every Trainer\r\ngathered here who aimed for new heights...[VAR 0114(0011)]
and that the seeds for many more future\nChampions will be sown![VAR 0114(0011)]
I eagerly await news of all your achievements![VAR 0114(0011)]
Thank you, Chairwoman Geeta.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Now, alas, it is time for this wonderful tournament\nto come to an end...\c\nBUT![VAR 0114(000A)]
This event seems to me to be a wonderful way to\nbuild rapport between faculty and students and\r\ninvigorate the wider community beyond our walls.\c\nSo...[VAR 0114(000A)]
I hereby declare that the Academy Ace\nTournament will not end as a one-time event\r\nand will continue to be held regularly![VAR 0114(000A)]
Wooo! Awesome! Director Clavell, you’re the\nbest!
Maybe I’ll join next time, too!
Oh my gosh, YES! This is everything I wanted![VAR 0114(0004)]
I do hope you’ll participate next time,\nMiss Nemona.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Absolutely! I wouldn’t miss it for anything![VAR 0114(0004)]

Welcome to the Alfornada Gym! Would you like\nme to explain the rules of the Gym Test again?
The Gym Test here is a special kind of [VAR FF00(0006)]exercise[VAR FF00(0000)]!
I’m talking about the [VAR FF00(0006)]Emotional Spectrum[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Practice[VAR FF00(0000)] created by Tulip herself, of course.\r\nComplete it, and you pass the test!
Head out of the Gym and turn left to find the\npractice area.\c\nThe woman wearing a black tracksuit will explain\nthe rules to you there.
Osu! Welcome, new kid! This is where we do\nEmotional Spectrum Practice.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Why is your battle studies teacher here at a\nPokémon Gym working as an instructor, you ask?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Well, I’ve been friends with the Gym Leader\nhere, Tulip, since we were kids.[VAR 0114(0024)]
We decided to have a Pokémon battle with a\nspecial rule—the loser has to do what the winner\r\nsays. So we battled, and, well...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Look, never mind what happened! Point is, this is\na chance to both get a workout in and help my\r\nfriend when I don’t have classes![VAR 0114(0024)]
The rules of Emotional Spectrum Practice—or ESP\nfor short—are simple!\c\nI’ll show you a certain movement, and all you\nhave to do is copy it![VAR 0114(0024)]
Ready to get this Gym Test started? I hope your\nbody and mind are ready for the challenge![VAR 0114(0024)]
Great! Let’s get to exercising! Show me an\neruption of emotions![VAR 0114(0024)]
OK! Preparation is important, after all. Come\ntalk to me again when you’re good and ready![VAR 0114(0024)]
Nice! You’re moving really well! Both you and\nyour Pokémon are looking great, new kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
That was awesome! I can’t stop grinning after\nwitnessing such perfect power of expression![VAR 0114(0024)]
That’s enough of a warm-up! Now let’s really put\nthose muscles to work with a Pokémon battle![VAR 0114(0024)]
You gotta keep moving! This is no ordinary\nbattle—this is a workout!
Great! I can hear your Pokémon AND your\nmuscles screaming with delight![VAR 0114(0024)]
I see you’re getting tired, but you’ve gotta hang\nin there! Time to start the second half![VAR 0114(0024)]
Covered in sweat and overflowing with emotion!\nThat was an impressive round![VAR 0114(0024)]
That was perfect! I almost lost track of who was\nteaching who![VAR 0114(0024)]
Don’t give up yet! It’s time for another battle!\nHold out against all that lactic acid![VAR 0114(0024)]
My goal is to grow strong and build muscle.\nAny tips?
Good job! You made it all the way through the\nESP exercise![VAR 0114(0024)]
You passed this test—no doubt about it!\nCongratulations![VAR 0114(0024)]
But you’re not done yet! Sprint over to the lobby\nstaffer on the double!\c\nYou have to report your passing grade to\nformally finish the Gym Test![VAR 0114(0024)]
Awww, that was close! But it looks like you may\nneed to train a bit harder before you can take\r\non the Psychic-type Gym for real![VAR 0114(0024)]
If you don’t plan on giving up, come back again\nsometime and show me what you’re made of![VAR 0114(0024)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Welcome to the Alfornada Gym,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].
Are you ready to challenge Gym Leader Tulip,\nthe Bewitching Beautician?
Very well. Allow me to show you to the\nbattle court.
Of course. Please feel free to come speak to me\nwhenever you’re ready.
I suppose you’re right. OK, I’ll get things moving\nhere on my end.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Let’s keep the tag line simple—\n“Naturally Beautiful.”[VAR 0114(002C)]
And order the new eye-shadow color too,\nwould you?[VAR 0114(002C)]
Thanks, you’re a doll. Gotta run now. Chat with\nyou later.[VAR 0114(002C)]
Hello there.[VAR 0114(002C)]
I’m Tulip, the Gym Leader here.\c\nThough I must tell you that being a makeup artist\nis my main line of work.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Dendra had nothing but praise for you. She said\nyou totally slayed out there.[VAR 0114(001C)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Hehe. I must say, you are a cute challenger,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(001C)]
I’m sure my ESP exercise made you all the more\nbeautiful. Doesn’t that make you happy?[VAR 0114(001C)]
You keep your Pokémon beautiful and clean as\nwell. I see you have quite the aesthetic sense.[VAR 0114(001C)]
[~ 14]
Appearance is equally important for both people\nand Pokémon.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Makeup is like magic. Anyone can use it to\nchange their appearance.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Allow me to put my skills to use to make your\ncute little Pokémon even more beautiful![VAR 0114(001C)]
I lost the battle? And your beauty rivals even my\nown? I can’t believe it.[VAR 0114(001C)]
You are quite splendid. Yes, truly amazing![VAR 0114(001C)]
Perhaps I should take you under my wing before\nyou make your big break elsewhere...[VAR 0114(001C)]
But I suppose I need to work on myself a little\nmore first before I run off and do such a thing.[VAR 0114(001C)]
You have earned my Gym Badge. Allow me to\nstrike one of my best poses to give it to you.\r\nCongratulations, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(001C)]
With [VAR 0200(0001)] Gym Badge[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s, Pokémon of up to Lv. [VAR 0201(0002)]\nwill be easier to catch and will listen to the\r\ncommands you give them.[VAR 0114(001C)]
With all 8 Gym Badges, you’ll be able to catch\nPokémon of any level. They’ll be good Pokémon\r\nand listen to your commands, too.[VAR 0114(001C)]
If you train hard, you’ll be able to use this move\nin a totally perfect way.[VAR 0114(001C)]
Don’t go uploading that selfie we just took to\nsocial media, OK?[VAR 0114(001C)]
I think my makeup has run a little with all the\nmoving and sweating I did during our battle.[VAR 0114(001C)]
I need to fix it fast before my next appointment.\nMy schedule is absolutely packed, you know.\c\nFarewell, then. You did splendidly today.[VAR 0114(001C)]

Winter mountains are dangerous. They can throw\nyour life right off course, easy as that.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Same thing with Pokémon battles, really...\nIt’s always the most dangerous when you’re\r\njust starting to get the hang of things.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Today’s not a great day to face me, you know...\nYou’re better off giving up.[VAR 0114(001A)]
You sure you want to battle me?[VAR 0114(001A)]
You bet!
Uh, I’m not sure now...
Still tryin’ to act cool, huh? That’s too bad.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Nice. Backing off takes its own kind of courage.\nBut I know your type. You always choose to push\r\nforward in the end.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Well, this is my job now...so don’t take what\nI’m about to do personally.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Get ready to feel the icy bite of reality.[VAR 0114(001A)]
That burning passion you have... You strive for\nthe future, no matter what challenges you face.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Just like how I used to be...[VAR 0114(001A)]
Oh, never mind. I should give you your\nGym Badge.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Huh? You want a photo together to\ncommemorate your win...?[VAR 0114(001A)]
C-come on, that’s...that’s so uncool.\nI don’t usually do that sort of thing, but...\r\nOK, fine. Special occasion.[VAR 0114(001A)]
With [VAR 0200(0001)] Gym Badge[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s, you should be able to catch\nPokémon of up to Lv. [VAR 0201(0002)] more easily.\c\nThey’ll actually listen to you too, which is nice.[VAR 0114(001A)]
With 8 Gym Badges, you should be able to catch\nPokémon of any level. They’ll also listen to every\r\nword you say, whether it’s cool or not.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Oh, and before I forget—you should take\nthis, too.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Should be a lot more useful than some silly\nphoto of you and me...[VAR 0114(001A)]
Feel free to stop by again... If you don’t mind the\ncold, that is.[VAR 0114(001A)]
Congratulations! You’re now certified by the\nGlaseado Gym!

Welcome to the Artazon Gym!
Let me register you as a challenger. Your name is\n[VAR 0100(0000)], yes?
Great! Now, in order to face Gym Leader\nBrassius, you’ll first need to pass the Gym Test.
Here at the Artazon Gym, that means completing\na game of [VAR FF00(0006)]Sunflora Hide-and-Seek[VAR FF00(0000)]!
As you may know, Artazon is a city of artists.\c\nThe artwork made by the people here is largely\ninspired by nature and the sun that nurtures it.\c\nSince Sunflora embody these concepts, we try to\ngather them and take good care of them!
Your job today is to find the Sunflora located\nthroughout Artazon. Remember—these Pokémon\r\nlook like sun-shaped flowers!
Gather up [VAR 0201(0001)] of them and bring them to the\nSunflora Lawn, and you pass the test.
I’ll register the Sunflora Lawn’s location in your\nmap app to get you started.\c\nWhen you leave the Gym, turn right and you’ll\nsee two large Sunflora statues—head for those!\c\nOnce you’re at the lawn’s entrance, the staffer\nthere will tell you more about the Gym Test.
Now get out there and have fun!

Now, please head back to the lobby at the\nArtazon Gym to report your result.

Just like before, please find [VAR 0201(0001)] Sunflora and\nbring them back here to the Sunflora Lawn.
Good luck out there!
If you leave Artazon, you’ll have to start Sunflora\nHide-and-Seek all over again next time.\r\nDo you still want to leave the town?
You quit the Gym Test!\c\nIf you want to try again, go to the Sunflora Lawn.
Are you sure you want to give up and quit\nplaying Sunflora Hide-and-Seek?
No. of Sunflora found

[VAR BD06(0000)]Welcome to the Artazon Gym,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].
Are you ready to challenge Gym Leader Brassius,\nthe Verdant Virtuoso?
Very well. Allow me to show you to the\nbattle court.
Of course. Please feel free to come speak to me\nwhenever you’re ready.
Greetings, challenger![VAR 0114(002C)]
Hmph![VAR 0114(002C)]
You did well to come this far![VAR 0114(002C)]
I am Brassius—an artist specializing in Grass-type\nPokémon. I am also the Gym Leader here at the\r\nArtazon Gym.[VAR 0114(0017)]
I was observing your Gym Test from atop the\nwindmill, you know.[VAR 0114(0017)]
The perception you displayed in finding Sunflora\nwas truly... Oh, how shall I describe it?[VAR 0114(0017)]
Yes! It was truly avant-garde![VAR 0114(0017)]
I only pray that you might demonstrate that eye\nfor beauty in our battle as well.[VAR 0114(0017)]
Enough talk! We must begin creating our\ncollaborative work of art![VAR 0114(0017)]
I trust that you are ready? It is time for our\nmasterpiece to take shape![VAR 0114(0017)]
[~ 14]
Oh! What artistic tactics you employ![VAR 0114(0017)]
The patterns of your moves! The minute details\nof your Pokémon’s performance! Everything you\r\ndid was honed to perfection![VAR 0114(0017)]
Our battle was, in a word, art! Indeed, if we\ncould not call that a work of artistry, then nothing\r\nelse in this world could be labeled as such![VAR 0114(0017)]
If I were to judge your work, I would say it passes\nmy inspection. Yes—a pass without exception![VAR 0114(0017)]
As proof of your artistic prowess, you may have\nmy Gym Badge! Shall we take a photo as well?[VAR 0114(0017)]
If you possess [VAR 0200(0001)] Gym Badge[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s, it will be easier\nto catch Pokémon of up to Lv. [VAR 0201(0002)], and those\r\nPokémon should follow your commands as well![VAR 0114(0017)]
If you possess 8 Gym Badges, you will be able\nto catch Pokémon of any level. And they will\r\nmost certainly obey your every command as well![VAR 0114(0017)]
To a fantastic Trainer such as yourself, I would\nalso like to offer this—a favorite of mine![VAR 0114(0017)]
Ah! My inspiration is overflowing, as if drawn\nfrom a bottomless well![VAR 0114(0017)]
I will begin on a new piece at once! You must\nexcuse me. Farewell![VAR 0114(0017)]
Congratulations! You’re now certified by the\nArtazon Gym!

Ah... Kofu! Wait!
Ahhh, he got away. How am I supposed to\nreturn this to him now...?
Oh, hey! You’re here as a Gym challenger, right?
Yep!
Uh...
I knew it! Of course you are!
You can’t fool me. You’re definitely a challenger!
That big man that just left is Kofu, leader\nof the Cascarrafa Gym.
He has a bit of a childlike side to him, and today\nhe’s run off to the market without his wallet.
He’ll be in big trouble without it...\c\nThat’s where you come in, kind Gym challenger!\nCould you please take Kofu’s wallet to him?
Ohhh! You are too kind! I’d give you a Gym\nBadge right now if I could!
I’m sorry, but it’s impossible to challenge our\nGym without Kofu here. I can’t exactly leave my\r\npost here at the lobby, either, so...
Here’s his wallet! I’m counting on you!
This can be your Gym Test here. If you do this for\nme, you pass!
Kofu’s headed to [VAR FF00(0006)]Porto Marinada[VAR FF00(0000)]. It’s on the\nother side of the desert to the west.
Be careful, though. There are many dangerous\nPokémon in the desert!

What? YOU again?!
Vaultin’ Veluza! Where?! Where in the world...?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Where in the world is my wallet?![VAR 0114(0018)]
Without my wallet, I won’t be able to get today’s\nhot item! It’ll get bought up by someone else![VAR 0114(0018)]
*sniffle*[VAR 0114(0018)]
Don’t worry, ol’ man Kofu! I’ll run and look for it\nright now!
Whaddya want? Ol’ man Kofu’s in the middle of\nsome superduper important ingredient buyin’!
If yer thinkin’ about tryin’ to interrupt him, then\nI—his best apprentice—will have to stop you!
So do ya have somethin’ super important to\nsay to us busy folks, or what?
This is super important!
Uh, I guess it’s not that important...
Don’t bother us with somethin’ unimportant! Run\nback on home now, y’hear!
Super important, eh? We’ll see about that!\nMaybe a battle will shut yer mouth!
Dangit! That backfired... And now my wallet’s\nempty, too!
Heya, step right up...and tell me—what’s all the\nruckus about over here?[VAR 0114(0018)]
O-ol’ man Kofu! Seems this kid’s got somethin’\nto say to ya.
What’s that, now? A customer here for little ol’\nwalletless, moneyless me? What kin I do for ya?[VAR 0114(0018)]
I have your wallet!
You forgot this!
You returned Kofu’s wallet to him!
Vaultin’ Veluza! My wallet![VAR 0114(0018)]
Say what, now? My lobby staffer sent ya out here\nto bring it to me?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Gahaha! That’s a huge help! Thanks for comin’\nall this way![VAR 0114(0018)]
I guess I should apologize for my li’l apprentice,\ntoo. Hope he didn’t bother ya too much![VAR 0114(0018)]
There’s somethin’ here at the Porto Marinada\n[VAR FF00(0006)]auction[VAR FF00(0000)] that we really wanna get our hands on.[VAR 0114(0018)]
So, as you kin imagine, we were both a bit\nworked up to find I’d forgotten my wallet![VAR 0114(0018)]
Ladies and gents! You won’t wanna miss this!\nHere comes today’s last item!
Hmmm?[VAR 0114(0018)]
Feast yer eyes on the main event! I have ’ere the\nlegendary wakame seaweed of the Hoenn region!\r\nDo I have any takers?
Vaultin’ Veluza![VAR 0114(0018)]
I don’ even have to touch it—I can see it’s got the\nspringy texture of seaweed chock-full o’ nutrients![VAR 0114(0018)]
An’ just look at it! Look how it catches the light\nand shines so brilliantly![VAR 0114(0018)]
Ohhh, and that rich, fresh aroma of somethin’\nplucked straight outta the ocean![VAR 0114(0018)]
I need to get me some o’ that![VAR 0114(0018)]
Now listen, kid. If you wanna challenge me at the\nCascarrafa Gym, you’re gonna need some smarts.[VAR 0114(0018)]
And this is the perfect place to test ya! Get the\nwinnin’ bid on that seaweed for this ol’ man![VAR 0114(0018)]
What’s a “winning bid”?
OK! I’ll give it my best shot!
Well, ya see...here at the auction, you gotta\ncompete with other customers for goods!\c\nYou gotta be aware of how much money ya have,\no’ course, but the person who bids the highest\r\nprice gets to buy whatever’s on sale![VAR 0114(0018)]
Gahaha! You already know the ins an’ outs of\nauctions at such a young age?\c\nYou’re somethin’ else, kid![VAR 0114(0018)]

Welcome to the Cortondo Gym!
Let me register you as a challenger. Your name is\n[VAR 0100(0000)], yes?
Great! Now, in order to face Gym Leader Katy,\nyou’ll first need to pass the Gym Test.

Olive production is a big part of life in Cortondo.\c\nWe’ve held the Olive Harvest Festival here each\nyear for generations to usher in bumper crops!

Welcome to the Cortondo Gym! Would you like\nme to explain the rules of the Gym Test again?
The Gym Test here is the [VAR FF00(0006)]Olive Roll[VAR FF00(0000)]!
To pass the test, you’ll need to roll an olive-\nshaped ball all the way to the goal.\c\nYour efforts should help ensure we get a great\nolive harvest next year, too!
When you’re ready to start, head to the olive-\nrolling field just to the [VAR FF00(0006)]north of town[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nThe staffer over there will explain the rules to\nyou in further detail.
Welcome to the olive-rolling field!
This Gym Test is all about stamina—you’ll need\nto push with all you’ve got to get a large olive\r\nball rolling and make it all the way to the end.
Get the ball over various obstacles, then push it\ninto the goal to clear the course.
Now that you’re all filled in, are you ready to\nstart the Gym Test?
Great! Put in a wish for a good olive harvest,\nand roll, roll, roll away!
No problem. Just come let me know when you’re\nall set to go.
Welcome back! Are you ready for some\nolive rolling?
Here, I’ll open up a shortcut for you...if you\nmanage to defeat me!
Let’s see if you can get past my wall of Smoliv!
OK, Team Smoliv! Time to clear the way!
You should ride a Pokémon and get it to push the\nolive for you. It’ll be much easier to roll that way!
With that performance, I’m sure we can look\nforward to a great olive harvest next year!
I’m happy to declare your Gym Test officially\ncleared. Congratulations!
Please report your result to the lobby staffer at\nthe Gym. Good luck in your battle against Katy!
Do you want to give up on the Olive Roll\nfor now?
Are you sure you want to quit?
[~ 24]
[~ 25]
[~ 26]
I’ll keep going
I’d like to quit
If you’re looking for a shortcut, you gotta earn it!\nYou’re not getting past me easily!
Even the Smoliv can tell how strong you are!\nThey’ll step aside for you now.
I got in the way of your olive rolling because I\nwanted you to see how tough it is to grow olives!
Give Up

My main line of work is crafting sweets as a\npastry chef.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Little sweets that bring happiness with just one\nbite, Bug-type Pokémon hiding in foliage...\r\nBoth are small and yet very powerful.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Don’t let your guard down unless you would like\nto find yourself knocked off your feet![VAR 0114(0016)]
Your strength rose during our battle like a nice\nbread in the oven.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I feel that I may need to work on my own\nstrength as well![VAR 0114(0016)]
Congratulations! You passed! As proof of your\nvictory against me—the Gym Leader—allow me\r\nto present you with this Gym Badge.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I hope you’ll enjoy it alongside a heaping serving\nof some of my deluxe handmade treats![VAR 0114(0016)]
With [VAR 0200(0001)] Gym Badge[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s in your possession, Pokémon\nof up to Lv. [VAR 0201(0002)] will be easier to catch and will\r\nlisten to your commands as well.[VAR 0114(0016)]
With 8 Gym Badges in your possession, you will\nbe able to catch Pokémon of any level. They will\r\nall certainly listen to your commands as well.[VAR 0114(0016)]
I see you have quite the appetite as well! How\nabout a little TM as the frosting on this cake?[VAR 0114(0016)]
Once you’ve found a TM during your travels,\nyou can then use a TM Machine to make copies\r\nof that TM. You did know that, right?[VAR 0114(0016)]
I wish you luck in your future adventures. May\nthey be as sweet and lovely as a good dessert.[VAR 0114(0016)]
Off you go, then. Until we meet again![VAR 0114(0016)]
Congratulations! You’re now certified by the\nCortondo Gym!

You must be a Gym Test challenger...[VAR 0114(0038)]
Well, what I’m having right now is something\nquite ordinary, but...[VAR 0114(0038)]
Here’s a tip for you. A nice squeeze of [VAR FF00(0006)]lemon[VAR FF00(0000)]\ngives any dish a refreshing kick.[VAR 0114(0038)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Welcome to the Medali Gym,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].
If you want to face Gym Leader Larry, please\nspeak to the waiter at the Treasure Eatery.
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Welcome to the\nTreasure\r\nEatery—proud\r\nto\r\nbe\r\nsupporting\r\nthe\r\nMedali Gym!

In that case, please head onto the battle court.
Please feel free to come back whenever you\nare ready.
Laaarrryyy! You’re up!
Hello.[VAR 0114(002C)]
I’m Larry. I’m assigned to work as the Gym\nLeader of the Medali Gym.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Good job on making your way through the\nGym Test.[VAR 0114(0015)]
And, well...maybe try the other dishes on the\nmenu too sometime. Everything’s good here.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Anyway, my boss will dock my pay if I spend too\nmuch time chitchatting.\c\nLet’s get this battle over with.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Thank you for doing business with us today.\nI, Larry, will be at your service.[VAR 0114(0015)]
You’re rather strong, aren’t you? Enough to bring\nout my poker face, even.[VAR 0114(0015)]
I lost, so that means I have to give you a\nbadge, but...[VAR 0114(0015)]
That battle made me a bit hungry. Care to join\nme for a meal?[VAR 0114(0015)]
Having [VAR 0200(0001)] Gym Badge[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s in hand makes it easier to\ncatch Pokémon of up to Lv. [VAR 0201(0002)].\c\nOh, and they’ll actually listen to you, too...[VAR 0114(0015)]
If you have 8 Gym Badges, you’ll be able to\ncatch Pokémon of any level. They’ll never\r\nquestion who’s the boss, either.[VAR 0114(0015)]
The dishes here... They’ve all got flavor.\nGood flavor, I mean.[VAR 0114(0015)]
This is for you. Though hopefully a child like you\nhas no need to put on its namesake...[VAR 0114(0015)]
Oh, don’t worry about the bill. I do earn a salary,\nafter all.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Now, I’d better get back to work. If you’ll\nexcuse me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
Congratulations! You’re now certified by the\nMedali Gym!

Osu, new kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
Have you come out here to the schoolyard for\nsome training?![VAR 0114(0024)]
Aha! I knew I could see a fighting spirit burning\nbehind those eyes of yours![VAR 0114(0024)]
Ah! Sorry. That was a little rude of me to ask.\nI know the point of training isn’t to show off in\r\nfront of other people.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Why don’t we do a bit of running together here\nto get to know each other a little better?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Ready? Let’s go![VAR 0114(0024)]
You ran three laps around the schoolyard with\nMs. Dendra...
Phew! That really worked up a nice sweat![VAR 0114(0024)]
You’ve got a good pair of legs on ya, new kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
A good bout of training sure does make a body\nhungry, doesn’t it?[VAR 0114(0024)]
I’ll let you have one of my homemade\nsandwiches as my way of saying thanks for\r\nrunning with me today! Feed those muscles![VAR 0114(0024)]
Ms. Dendra’s sandwich was dry and had an odd\nsmell. The taste left much to be desired...
How was it? I hope it was tasty.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Uh, yeah, tasty...
Well, to be honest...
Sorry. I shouldn’t have asked you that. Heh...[VAR 0114(0024)]
I’m athletic and all, but I don’t know the first\nthing about making good food...[VAR 0114(0024)]
as your honest reaction just reminded me.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Well, uh...see you later. Enjoy your sore muscles\ntomorrow.[VAR 0114(0024)]
You became slightly closer with Ms. Dendra!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : kizuna_battle_b.dat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Osu, new kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
Fancy meeting you here in the home economics\nclassroom! What a coincidence, eh?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Likewise!
What brings you here?
So, uh...well, y’see...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Ms. Dendra tells me she is here for intensive\ntraining in sandwich making.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Aww. Well, no use hiding it now...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Oh dear. I’m terribly sorry. Were you keeping this\na secret?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Well, I mean, not really...but it just doesn’t look\nvery cool to openly admit I’m here for “intensive\r\ntraining.” Y’know?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Understood. I will be more careful in the future.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Well, new kid, now that you know what I’m\nup to...[VAR 0114(0024)]
I guess you’ll just have to help me out with my\ntraining here![VAR 0114(0024)]
Try this sandwich! It’s the result of my training\nso far.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Ms. Dendra’s sandwich was soggy and hard to\neat. And, once again, the taste left much to be\r\ndesired...
That was my meat lover’s prosciutto, bacon, and\nchorizo sandwich! How was it?[VAR 0114(0024)]
It was, uh, a little meat heavy...
It could have used some more veggies...
What?! You mean there was a problem with my\nchoice of filling?[VAR 0114(0024)]
I guess focusing on muscle-building ingredients\nreally did a number on the flavor, huh...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Ms. Dendra, I believe a simple addition of butter\nwould have done wonders for your sandwich.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Butter helps to protect the bread from getting\nsoggy due to the moisture of the ingredients.\r\nIt can also work to enhance the sandwich’s flavor.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Butter! That makes sense! Thank you for teaching\nme that tip, Mr. Saguaro![VAR 0114(0024)]
But why didn’t you tell me that while I was\nmaking the sandwich?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Ah...well, you see...when I saw you, I had not\nrealized you had begun your, ahem, food prep.\c\nI thought you were simply trying to destroy\nmy classroom.[VAR 0114(0029)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0024)]
Well, anyway![VAR 0114(0024)]
New kid! Thanks to you and Mr. Saguaro here,\nI may finally be getting the hang of this![VAR 0114(0024)]
Thanks for your advice![VAR 0114(0024)]
You became even closer with Ms. Dendra!

No way. No way! NO WAY![VAR 0114(0028)]
C’mon, Miriam! Just try it![VAR 0114(0024)]
Ms. Dendra!
What’s wrong?
Oh! Great timing, new kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
Nurse Miriam here won’t try the sandwich I made![VAR 0114(0024)]
Well, DUH! I don’t want to get a stomachache![VAR 0114(0028)]
You won’t! Probably![VAR 0114(0024)]
Uh, I still remember that “sandwich” you made\nme with meat filling and meat for bread.\r\nThat one really messed me up bad.[VAR 0114(0028)]
I hadn’t trained in the art of sandwich making yet\nback then! I was young and thoughtless and—[VAR 0114(0024)]
“Young and thoughtless”? It was LAST MONTH![VAR 0114(0028)]
Sooo, as you can see, I’m not getting anywhere\ntrying to persuade her.[VAR 0114(0024)]
Even after I went through that intensive sandwich-\nmaking training! It kinda makes me sad...[VAR 0114(0024)]
She went through intensive sandwich-making\ntraining?[VAR 0114(0028)]
She worked really hard at it!
You should try her sandwich
Ugh...[VAR 0114(0028)]
I guess I have no choice if you’ve got one of our\ncute little students on your side.[VAR 0114(0028)]
So, fine. I’ll try your sandwich. Let’s see it.[VAR 0114(0028)]
Yesss! I knew you’d come around. Here it is...[VAR 0114(0024)]
*munch munch munch*[VAR 0114(0028)]
It’s a little strongly flavored, but...I guess it’s\nnot bad?[VAR 0114(0028)]
Woo-hoo! My training paid off![VAR 0114(0024)]
I’m so glad my sandwich pleases the great\nNurse Miriam! I look up to you, you know![VAR 0114(0024)]
You feel trusted by Ms. Dendra!
Thank you for trying it! And thanks to you too,\nnew kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
Aaand she’s run off again. That was weird...[VAR 0114(0028)]
But that’s just how Ms. Dendra is, I guess. She’s\nalways coming into the nurse’s office with some\r\ninjury or another, too.[VAR 0114(0028)]

Osu, new kid! You here to do a little shopping?[VAR 0114(0024)]
Yep! I’m here to shop
I came to see you
The school store’s a nice place! They’ve got\neverything you need right here![VAR 0114(0024)]
Hahaha! So you came to see me, did you?[VAR 0114(0024)]
I’m here to check out the sandwiches they’ve got\nfor sale.[VAR 0114(0024)]
The school store’s sandwiches taste great and\nhave excellent nutritional balance, too![VAR 0114(0024)]
You’re not making your own?
What happened to your intensive training?
Haha. I guess I’m just not used to it yet. All that\ntraining kind of wore me out![VAR 0114(0024)]
I achieved my goal, anyway, so I’m going to take\na break from sandwich making for a bit![VAR 0114(0024)]
Oh, right. I didn’t tell you what my goal was.\c\nI wanted to pay Nurse Miriam back for everything\nshe does for me. It was my way of saying thanks![VAR 0114(0024)]
She’s so nice and so skilled at what she does.\nI really look up to her![VAR 0114(0024)]
I wanted to try sandwich making so I could be\nskilled at doing something for other people, like\r\nshe is, but I guess I just wasn’t cut out for it.[VAR 0114(0024)]
What I am cut out for, though, is being full of\nenergy! So I decided to focus on that instead![VAR 0114(0024)]
Like I said in class, I think people and Pokémon\nshould make their strong points stronger![VAR 0114(0024)]
You really helped me out, new kid! Take this as\nmy way of saying thanks.[VAR 0114(0024)]
All right, then! What should I go with today to\nget my protein in?[VAR 0114(0024)]

...Not really?
A little context, please?
Ah. Sorry. Your jump scare earlier completely\nfrazzled me. My brain’s still trying to reboot.[VAR 0114(0008)]
All right, here’s the sitch. Team Star’ve started\ncoming to school again...[VAR 0114(0008)]
But I don’t know if they’re gonna fit in OK, and\nit’s been playing on my mind, you know?\r\nSo I’m checking on them from over here...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hmph... Guess we’re still not exactly gettin’ a\nwarm welcome here, huh?[VAR 0114(0021)]
Well, duh.[VAR 0114(0020)]
Sure, the teachers finally figured out we’re not a\nbunch of delinquents...[VAR 0114(0020)]
But it’s not like we can press some magic button\nto make everyone else accept us.[VAR 0114(0020)]
True story. We gotta fix this, my man. Time for a\nchange of tack![VAR 0114(0021)]
Huh? A change of tack...?\c\nWhat, are they gonna start wearing normal school\nuniforms so they stop scaring off the other kids?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh, Momo... Ortie... They’re both really trying\ntheir best to fit in here at school...[VAR 0114(0008)]
A “change of tack,” huh? What exactly are\nyou suggesting?[VAR 0114(0020)]

Errr. Yeah, that idea seems a bit...off.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hold up—lemme explain.[VAR 0114(0021)]
You know Ryme, right? She does this at her\nconcerts, no joke.[VAR 0114(0021)]

Yeah, that makes sense. ’Cause those are\nCONCERTS. This is SCHOOL. It’s different.[VAR 0114(0020)]
OK, smart guy. So we’re optin’ for the cold\nshoulder treatment forever, then, are we?[VAR 0114(0021)]
N-no... That’d totally suck.[VAR 0114(0020)]
It would, wouldn’t it? So yeah. Our only option is\nto yell at everyone so they know we’re nice.\r\nHere, I’m gonna go for it...[VAR 0114(0021)]
HEEEY!!! MORNIN’, Y’AAAAAALL!!!\nHOW WE ALL FEELIN’ TODAAAY??!![VAR 0114(0021)]
Oh nooo! Giacomo! What are you DOING?!\nThis is SO embarrassing![VAR 0114(0020)]
EVERYONE HAVIN’ A GOOD TIIIIIIME??!!\nC’mon, Ortega—you gotta do it, too![VAR 0114(0021)]
Hold on a sec! You...you’re just practicing for\nyour DJ sets, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0020)]
THANKS FOR COMIN’ TONIGHT!!!\nQuick! Say it![VAR 0114(0021)]
TH-THANKS FOR COMING TONIGHT!!![VAR 0114(0020)]
...HEY! What do you mean, “thanks for coming”?!\nWe’re not hosting anything![VAR 0114(0020)]
What. On. Earth.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Are those guys from Team Star? What the heck\nare they yelling for?
Is this some kind of skit? Heh...they’re pretty\nfunny!
I guess they’re not as scary as I thought...?
No way...[VAR 0114(0008)]
P-people are actually warming up to them?!\nWhy? That makes zero sense![VAR 0114(0008)]
Haaah... Momo and Ortie really are operating\non a different level. I’m kind of amazed.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Seems all my worrying was for nothing, huh?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Now that that’s all settled, I guess I should get\ngoing. Hasta la vistar! ☆[VAR 0114(0008)]

*whisper*\nI’m checking in on Atticus.\c\n*whisper*\nSo keep your voice down, OK?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Okeydokey
*whisper whisper*
*whisper*\n’Preciate it.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hmmmmmm...[VAR 0114(0023)]
I must say, the academy emporium stocks some\nrather splendid wares.[VAR 0114(0023)]
I admit my expectations were far lower\nthan warranted.[VAR 0114(0023)]
Wow. He really seems to have taken a shine to\nthe school store...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Doesn’t seem like he’ll notice us anytime soon,\nso I guess there’s no point whispering.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You know, of all my Team Star friends, it’s Atticus\nI’m worried will have the most trouble fitting in...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Greetings, my good shopkeep.[VAR 0114(0023)]
I would very much like to acquire the limited-\nedition ninja garments released today.\c\nI believe you have five sets in stock, yes?[VAR 0114(0023)]
Ah... The ninja cosplay set, yes?
I’m sorry, dear, but someone bought the last two\nfrom us earlier. We’re completely sold out.
What?! This cannot be!!![VAR 0114(0023)]
If I am unable to procure those garments, why...\nI... That will ruin everything![VAR 0114(0023)]
It appears I have no choice but to track down\nthis rival patron of mine! And when I find them...[VAR 0114(0023)]
I shall fix them with my piercing gaze and beg on\nbended knee for the ninja garments I so crave![VAR 0114(0023)]
Whaaaaaat?! Since WHEN was Atticus this\ngood-looking?![VAR 0114(0008)]
Wait, no, focus! If he starts begging some kid for\ntheir ninja outfit, people will think he’s a weirdo.\r\nWe should stop him, right?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Yeah, time for an intervention
Let’s just see how this pans out
Th-then that’s what we’ll do![VAR 0114(0008)]
Seriously? But...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh, Don Atticus! Here you are!
My young compadre![VAR 0114(0023)]
I...I must apologize.[VAR 0114(0023)]
About the garments I promised you so that we\nmight dress as ninja together...[VAR 0114(0023)]
Oh yeah, I got us covered! I already bought two\nsets of that ninja cosplay stuff for us to wear!
...I beg your pardon?[VAR 0114(0023)]
When I came here earlier, the shopkeeper lady\nwas putting them out on the shelves.\c\nSo I bought one for you and one for me!
You know how popular these outfits are...\nI was super lucky to be able to snag ’em!
Now c’mon! Let’s go play ninja outside!
Goodness me... What a happy turn of events![VAR 0114(0023)]
I shall retrieve my shuriken from my quarters\nso that we might enjoy some target practice![VAR 0114(0023)]
Ooooooh! Awesome!
I can also use my masterful stitchery to transform\nthy ninja garments into a sublime vision of poison!\r\nWhat say you?[VAR 0114(0023)]
Ummm... I’m good, thanks.
Ha ha ha! The insolence of this one![VAR 0114(0023)]
Phew... Looks like he was able to wrap up this\nlittle escapade without making a scene.[VAR 0114(0008)]
But more importantly—Atticus has already made\na friend at school![VAR 0114(0008)]
Kinda makes me feel bad that I thought I had to\nspy on him...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Anyway, I guess I’ll get going. Hasta la vistar! ☆[VAR 0114(0008)]

H-how you doing, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’ve never been inside the art room before.\nIt smells like paint in here—but in a good way.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Something up?
What brings you here?
Um. Well...[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’m worried about this rumor that’s going round.\c\nPeople are saying Team Star’s planning to raid\nthe art room or something.[VAR 0114(0008)]
It’s probably just rubbish made up by some kids\nwho are still scared of Team Star though.[VAR 0114(0008)]
My friends would never do anything like that.\nAnd who’d want to raid the art room, anyway?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Knock knock! We’re comin’ in!!![VAR 0114(001F)]
GAH! They actually showed up?![VAR 0114(0008)]
Wow, this Staraptor is incredible! It looks just like\nit’s about to attack with Close Combat![VAR 0114(0022)]
Hey. You with the art club or what?[VAR 0114(001F)]
Uh, y-yeah, I am...?
... ... ...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Don’t tell me that rumor was for real! Are they\nactually gonna raid the art room?![VAR 0114(0008)]
N-no, there’s no way. They wouldn’t. We should\njust keep watching...[VAR 0114(0008)]
So, um, did...did you need anything?
Um, yeah. I, uh...I’m here to ask...you know...if...[VAR 0114(001F)]
If...?
IF YOU GOT ANY LAST WORDS, PUNK![VAR 0114(001F)]
No WAY! It’s a raid! This is literally a RAID![VAR 0114(0008)]
Oh, knock it off, Mellie![VAR 0114(0022)]
Being shy is one thing, but you can’t go around\nthreatening people to cover it up![VAR 0114(0022)]
R-right, sorry, Eri. My bad...[VAR 0114(001F)]
So, uh...about your club. The art club, I mean.\nI, um...I was wondering if...I...could join...[VAR 0114(001F)]
Oh! You wanted to ask about club membership!\nSheesh, you had me scared there!
We’re open to any students who want to join.\nBut, uhhh...
Yes! Isn’t that great, Mellie?[VAR 0114(0022)]
Hang on, Eri. This guy’s still got somethin’ to say.\c\nSpit it out, then. I gotta earn my way in or what?[VAR 0114(001F)]
Ah, no, it’s just— I was hoping I could ask what\nprompted you to go for the art club, that’s all.
You’re askin’ me why I wanna join? Well, if I\ngotta explain...[VAR 0114(001F)]
One of my pals made this outfit for me.\nThese sick boots and everythin’.[VAR 0114(001F)]
I’m big into flame patterns like this, so...I wanna\ntry and make somethin’ like it myself.[VAR 0114(001F)]
So. Yeah. PAINTING! That’s what I wanna do![VAR 0114(001F)]
I’m a total newbie at it, but...[VAR 0114(001F)]
I realized somethin’ when I saw that real simple-\nlookin’ Fletchling painting on the wall there.\c\nI don’t hafta be some genius artist. I just wanna\nmake art that has its own charm, y’know?[VAR 0114(001F)]
The Fletchling painting? Um...I did that one.
That one’s YOURS?! I thought it was, like, a\nfinger painting by a kindergartener or something![VAR 0114(001F)]
Ha ha! Yeah, I get that all the time.
Our president’s paintings are real lovable ’cause\nthey’re real simple! Everyone says so!
HUH? You’re the art club’s PRESIDENT?[VAR 0114(001F)]
I can already tell we’ll have a lot of fun in the\nclub together! Could you tell us your name?
Your boots are awesome! Can I get a closer look?
Th-the name’s Mela... And yeah, good eye!\nMy boots are the best. A pal of mine who’s a\r\nbig arts-and-crafts nerd made them for me.[VAR 0114(001F)]
So the raid thing was just a misunderstanding...\c\nWell, that’s a relief. But wow...I didn’t know that\nMellie wanted to join the art club.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I can’t wait to see what Mellie paints! I bet it’ll be\nsomething amazing, huh?[VAR 0114(0022)]
Yeah, I guess...[VAR 0114(0008)]
GAH! Eri?! How’d you know we were here?![VAR 0114(0008)]
Wait, were you supposed to be hiding?\c\nI was wondering what was going on—you were\njust kinda hanging out in the open over here...[VAR 0114(0022)]
But you don’t need to worry anyway. Mellie’s\nbeen too nervous to notice you.[VAR 0114(0022)]
Wow. So even Mellie gets the jitters sometimes.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Trying new things is scary for everyone.\nThat’s why I came with her for moral support.\r\nBut you know? I think she’ll be just fine.[VAR 0114(0022)]
And she’s not the only one doing something new!\nCarmen and I have started up a wrestling club.[VAR 0114(0022)]
Mellie will have a blast here, I’m sure, so I gotta\nkeep up with her! I’ll enjoy the time I have left at\r\nthe academy as much as I can![VAR 0114(0022)]
Anyway, it was nice bumping into you both!\nHasta la vistar! ☆[VAR 0114(0022)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Mellie and Eri really are putting themselves out\nthere, aren’t they.[VAR 0114(0008)]

Oh! Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
Welcome to my classroom. All the students here\nare in the STEM track, just like me.[VAR 0114(0008)]
So, uh...there’s something I wanna talk to\nyou about.[VAR 0114(0008)]
But not here. Let’s go somewhere we can talk\nin private.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Th-this is my room. Make yourself at home.[VAR 0114(0008)]
It’s nice and cozy in here
A little crowded, isn’t it?
Hehe. I know, right? Being surrounded by my\nVeevees and figurines is my kinda heaven![VAR 0114(0008)]
Wait, seriously? Is it the boxes from all my online\norders? Maybe I oughta get rid of ’em, huh...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Anyway, you must be wondering why I brought\nyou here. It’s about my Team Star friends.[VAR 0114(0008)]
They...they really mean the world to me. I love\nthem all so much that I got scared they weren’t\r\ngonna fit in OK or be happy at school.[VAR 0114(0008)]
That’s why I’ve been sorta spying on them since\nthey came back.[VAR 0114(0008)]
But it turns out I didn’t need to worry.\nThey’re already having a great time![VAR 0114(0008)]
And now I feel bad that I didn’t have it in me to\nbelieve in them in the first place...[VAR 0114(0008)]
They’ve all grown so much, but I haven’t changed\nsince Operation Starfall.\c\nI’m still scheming up ways to fix things by myself\ninstead of having a little faith.[VAR 0114(0008)]
It’s only natural you’d worry
You just need to believe in them!
Y-you really think so? That’s a normal thing for\nfriends to do?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Y-yeah. I know. I promise I’ll try, but it might take\nme a little while to get there.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Huh... I feel better after talking it out with you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Thanks.[VAR 0114(0008)]
And, um, I want you to know you’re a really\nimportant friend to me, too.[VAR 0114(0008)]
That goes for Nemona as well! And even Arven\nand Koraidon![VAR 0114(0008)]
That goes for Nemona as well! And even Arven\nand Miraidon![VAR 0114(0008)]
You know, I don’t normally like having people in\nmy room.[VAR 0114(0008)]
But you’re an exception. Stop by for a chat\nor whatever anytime![VAR 0114(0008)]

I have a question for you. Do you find my class\ndifficult?[VAR 0114(0012)]
A little bit, yeah...
It’s just right for me!
Hmm... Perhaps I need to improve how I convey\nthe material.[VAR 0114(0012)]
That is certainly good to hear.[VAR 0114(0012)]
So, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0012)]
You chose to take on the Gyms as part of your\nTreasure Hunt.[VAR 0114(0012)]
That must mean you like Pokémon battles. Is that\ncorrect?[VAR 0114(0012)]
One naturally becomes skilled at doing what they\nenjoy. That must be why you are so strong.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Then you’re attempting to overcome a weakness?\nI applaud your efforts, indeed![VAR 0114(0012)]
Ah, do forgive me for springing such an odd\nquestion upon you so suddenly.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I often find myself pondering the nature of\nstrength these days...[VAR 0114(0012)]

Hello there, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
I try to visit the schoolyard from time to time.[VAR 0114(0012)]
It’s good to see young ones with so much energy\nand vigor...[VAR 0114(0012)]
You think so?
I know what you mean...
Oh, yes indeed. Just watching is enough to make\neven an old man like me feel more alive.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Do you? That’s a bit of a surprise to hear you say.\nYou’re one of the young ones too, you know.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Master Hassel. Might I have a word?
You... What are you doing here?[VAR 0114(0012)]
I have told you many times not to bother me\nhere at the academy.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Yet, I am bound to come. Our family’s future is of\nparamount importance.
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]It was good speaking with you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh! Why, hello there, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m sorry. I was lost in thought and didn’t notice\nyour approach.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I feel I must again apologize for what transpired\nin the schoolyard...[VAR 0114(0012)]
It didn’t bother me
What’re you talking about?
Hah... That is very magnanimous of you.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m of course referring to how I rather suddenly\nhad to take my leave while we were still engaged\r\nin conversation.[VAR 0114(0012)]
That woman who showed up is a Dragon Tamer—\nand a relative of mine, I might add.[VAR 0114(0012)]
You see, I come from a very long line of Trainers\nwho specialize in Dragon-type Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
There was a child in our family who was expected\nto stand at its head and lead it to greatness.[VAR 0114(0012)]
But the young lad, rebellious little fellow that he\nwas, ran away from home one day.[VAR 0114(0012)]
He made quite the show of it, too, swearing he’d\n“make a living with music”![VAR 0114(0012)]
A lot happened since then, and...now he’s the art\nteacher and Elite Four member before you![VAR 0114(0012)]
After I so rudely took my leave during our last\nconversation, my dear relative...encouraged me\r\nto give up teaching and return home at last.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’ve been told the current leader of my family—\nthat is to say, my father—is in poor health.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Oh, but I do apologize. Perhaps I am not cut out\nfor teaching after all... What sort of teacher\r\ngrumbles on and on at his own student?[VAR 0114(0012)]
You’re a great teacher!
I don’t want you to quit teaching!
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, my dear [VAR 0100(0000)]... You\nhave\r\nno\r\nidea\r\nhow\r\nmuch\r\nyour\r\nwords\r\nmean\r\nto me.[VAR 0114(0012)]

You always seem to appear at the most crucial\nof moments.[VAR 0114(0012)]
The most crucial of moments?
Is something going on?
Well, you see...[VAR 0114(0012)]
Master Hassel. I am here to collect you.
So I see.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I’m glad that you’ve finally made up your mind\nabout taking your place as leader of the family.
Well...[VAR 0114(0012)]
It is indeed true that I have made up my mind.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I have made up my mind to continue teaching\nhere at the academy![VAR 0114(0012)]
H-how could you?! Are you saying you don’t care\nwhat happens to our proud lineage?!
I am saying that I have other priorities![VAR 0114(0012)]
Have a look around at the art decorating this\nroom, would you?[VAR 0114(0012)]
The children here are letting their senses—their\nperceptiveness—grow freely![VAR 0114(0012)]
I do not wish to say that protecting our family’s\nancient bloodline is of no importance...[VAR 0114(0012)]
I simply wish to see young talent blossom and\ngrow into the future.[VAR 0114(0012)]
It just seems so much more fun to me, if I’m\nbeing honest![VAR 0114(0012)]
What utter nonsense.
And yet...
Your fearless, unflinching commitment to that\nnonsensical vision proves that you’re worthy of\r\ncarrying the will of the dragons, Master Hassel.
I will not give up. I will come as many times as I\nneed to in order to change your mind.
Oh, by all means, my door is open! I think you’ll\nsoon find you’ve met your match in stubbornness.[VAR 0114(0012)]
You thought I could be cowed by some story\nspun up about my father’s deteriorating health?\r\nI am not so easily fooled![VAR 0114(0012)]
Tch! I will return another day!
Ah, I’m sorry you had to see all of that.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I was so very close to resigning my post as\nteacher and returning to my home...[VAR 0114(0012)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]but the students here gave me courage to say no.\nThat includes you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nYour\r\nwords\r\ntruly\r\nbrought\r\nme strength.[VAR 0114(0012)]
I cannot think of a way I can possibly repay my\ndebt to you young ones.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Take this, if you will—insufficient as it may be in\nexpressing the full breadth of my gratitude.[VAR 0114(0012)]
Now then! Let it be clear to all![VAR 0114(0012)]
I, Hassel, will continue on my chosen path as\ninstructor to the youths of our world![VAR 0114(0012)]

Ah! Hello, hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(002A)]
I see you’ve already registered 200 species of\nPokémon to your Pokédex for me![VAR 0114(002A)]
Wow! Pokémon from the mountains! Pokémon\nfrom the sea! Wait, what?! No way!\r\nYou even found Pokémon in a place like this?![VAR 0114(002A)]
Ah...sorry about that. I got a little excited there.[VAR 0114(002A)]
My Pokémon research is moving along\nsuper-duper splendidly thanks to you![VAR 0114(002A)]
Here, take this. Consider it my way of saying\nthanks.[VAR 0114(002A)]
You’re a bona fide Pokémon catching\nprofessional, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(002A)]
For your next goal, it’s finally time to go for a\ncompleted Pokédex! Aim for 400 species![VAR 0114(002A)]
This is no easy feat, but I’m sure you can do it.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Keep tossing those Poké Balls, and don’t give up![VAR 0114(002A)]

Ah! Hello, hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(002A)]
What?! Are you telling me you’ve already\nregistered 400 species of Pokémon to your\r\nPokédex?![VAR 0114(002A)]
Wow! WOW! You did it! You completed the\nPokédex! That’s amazing! REALLY amazing![VAR 0114(002A)]
Research on the Pokémon of the Paldea region\nis moving ahead like never before! And it’s all\r\nthanks to you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(002A)]
You know, I visited this strange shop the other\nday and happened to pick up a little something...\c\nMight not seem like much to get a secondhand\ngift, but here! From me to you![VAR 0114(002A)]
I wish I could give you something a bit better for\nyour efforts...[VAR 0114(002A)]
Now what’s all this commotion about, I wonder?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Ah! Director Clavell! This student of mine\nCOMPLETED their Pokédex![VAR 0114(002A)]
Upon my word![VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]What a marvelous accomplishment,\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe really surprised me too, pulling off a feat\nlike this.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Well, Mr. Jacq’s delight clearly shows how\ncommendable your work has been.\c\nPlease, allow me to reward you with a small gift.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Students who achieve great feats such as this\ndeserve to be recognized for their hard work.\c\nThis congratulatory message, penned by the\ncompany that certifies Pokédex completion,\r\nis for you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I reconfigured your Pokédex app so that you may\nview your diploma there anytime you like.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Programming is another of Director Clavell’s\nskills, you know.[VAR 0114(002A)]
But anyway, you sure did great with the Pokédex,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(002A)]
If completing the Pokédex was one of the\ntreasures you were after, then I’d say you’ve had\r\na resounding success on your Treasure Hunt![VAR 0114(002A)]
Quite right, Mr. Jacq. A fitting comment indeed.\nIf rather surprising coming from you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Hehe... Well, I am h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser homeroom teacher, after\nall. Got to act like it from time to time, I guess.[VAR 0114(002A)]
You may have completed your Pokédex, but\nthere is still plenty of adventure to be had![VAR 0114(002A)]
I hope you’ll keep looking for new Pokémon to\nbefriend here in Paldea![VAR 0114(002A)]
I very much look forward to watching over your\ncontinued progress as well.[VAR 0114(000A)]

Man, you sure did give me a beating in that\nAcademy Ace Tournament![VAR 0114(0006)]
Seems like all my closest buddies are in another\nleague, you know?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I mean, look at you—you just up and became\na Champion! In your first year, to boot!\c\nYou know that’s pretty amazing, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Then there’s Nemona—top marks in every class\nat school, and she’s Champion-ranked too.[VAR 0114(0006)]
And I hear Penny’s got some kind of offer to\nwork for the Pokémon League or something?![VAR 0114(0006)]
I seem to be the only average one around here.\nNothing special about me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
You’re great at cooking!
Your [VAR 1107(00FF,0303)]momdad’s super famous!
Nah, I mean...it’s just, like, a hobby really.\c\nI only learned how to do the basics because my\n[VAR 1107(00FF,0303)]momdad wasn’t around to cook for me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Tch! You sure don’t give a guy a break, huh?\c\nSo, the only special thing about me is who my\n[VAR 1107(00FF,0303)]momdad was? Not like I had anything to do with it...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Wait! My [VAR 1107(00FF,0303)]momdad![VAR 0114(0006)]
See, now that Mabosstiff is doing so much better,\nand since the Treasure Hunt is still going and all,\r\nI’ve been thinking of a new goal: to find myself![VAR 0114(0006)]
And I guess you’ve really gotta start by knowing\nwhere you come from, which means...I should\r\nlearn more about my [VAR 1107(00FF,0303)]momdad, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
She was a student at this school once, too. That’s\nwhat I heard.[VAR 0114(0006)]
He was a student at this school once, too. That’s\nwhat I heard.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Take a look at this![VAR 0114(0006)]
This is supposed to be a sample from my mom’s\nresearch from back when she was a student![VAR 0114(0006)]
This is supposed to be a sample from my dad’s\nresearch from back when he was a student![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hehe, that’s what Director Clavell here told me.\nHe’s been helping me out.[VAR 0114(0006)]
When Sada was a student at this academy, I was\nstill a mere researcher myself.[VAR 0114(000A)]
When Turo was a student at this academy, I was\nstill a mere researcher myself.[VAR 0114(000A)]

So he really was always amazing...right from the\nstart, huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh! I guess I never really questioned it, but...\nwhy IS your office full of all this equipment?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Ho! So you’ve finally noticed, have you?[VAR 0114(000A)]
This room was once your mother’s research lab.[VAR 0114(000A)]
This room was once your father’s research lab.[VAR 0114(000A)]
It was?![VAR 0114(0006)]
From what I’ve heard recounted, [VAR 1107(00FF,0001)]she apparently\nwould become so absorbed in h[VAR 1107(00FF,0202)]eris research that\r\n[VAR 1107(00FF,0001)]she hardly ever returned to h[VAR 1107(00FF,0202)]eris dorm room.\c\n[VAR 1107(00FF,0102)]ShHe spent most nights sleeping here, in fact.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I also find myself more at ease surrounded by\nsuch research equipment, so I took the liberty\r\nof adapting the room to serve as my office.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I never knew...[VAR 0114(0006)]
All these pieces of my mom’s life—they were\nright in front of me this whole time...[VAR 0114(0006)]
All these pieces of my dad’s life—they were\nright in front of me this whole time...[VAR 0114(0006)]
I spent so long trying not to think about h[VAR 1107(00FF,0202)]erim\nthat I never even noticed...until now.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Thanks for telling me about this, Director Clavell![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]And, [VAR 0100(0000)], thanks for being\nhere\r\nwith\r\nme\r\nto\r\nlearn\r\nabout\r\nit, too![VAR 0114(0006)]
Ah, Master Arven! I also intended to explain\nabout these trophies here—[VAR 0114(000A)]
And he is already gone. Rather hard to pin down,\nisn’t he?\c\nOff like a flash as soon as some new thought\ncrosses his mind.[VAR 0114(000A)]

This book was so precious to my dad that he\neven kept a copy of it in the lighthouse lab...\r\nThe Violet Book... That’s what it’s called, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
This is my first time really reading the bits that\naren’t about the Herba Mystica—they’re amazing![VAR 0114(0006)]
I mean, it all sounds super fake, but it’s got all\nthese cool pictures and it’s real fun to read![VAR 0114(0006)]
Like, look at this entry here![VAR 0114(0006)]
The text on this page is all smudged and blurry in\nevery copy of this book I’ve ever seen.\c\nSeems kinda suspicious, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
’Course, the whole book is full of unbelievable\nstories, the Herba Mystica being one of them.\r\nBut they turned out to be real...\c\nAnd after everything we saw in Area Zero—well,\nmakes it hard to say it’s all nonsense, huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
In fact, I think it might’ve been this book that\nmade my mom want to become a researcher.[VAR 0114(0006)]

What do you think? Welcome to Chez Arven!\nWell, Chez Arven and Mabosstiff, really.[VAR 0114(0006)]

Why’s that surprising?! I’ll have you know that I\nclean every single day!\c\nMostly ’cause Mabosstiff sheds a ton, but still...[VAR 0114(0006)]

I went back and read the pages about the Herba\nMystica in the Scarlet Book again.[VAR 0114(0006)]

I couldn’t seem to do anything to help him, and...\nboy, it sure didn’t feel good.[VAR 0114(0006)]
’Course, I’m really glad that I was able to find\nall the Herba Mystica together with you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But there’s got to be other people who are still\nsuffering the same way I was back then, worrying\r\nabout their Pokémon that’re sick or hurt.[VAR 0114(0006)]
So... So I...I, uh...\c\nDon’t laugh, OK?[VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ve decided that I...I’m gonna become a cook![VAR 0114(0006)]

I’ll be behind you all the way!

Yeah! And thanks. I knew I could count on you\nto be all supportive like that.[VAR 0114(0006)]

How is your Treasure Hunt coming along?\nHaving all sorts of fun adventures, I hope?[VAR 0114(000A)]

It’s not going so well...
Wonderful. I’m glad to hear it.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Oh my. Is that so...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Do keep in mind that the Treasure Hunt has no\nset course or criteria you must follow.\c\nSimply go where your heart takes you, and you\nshall do splendidly.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Speaking of such pursuits, there has been\nsomething on my mind of late.[VAR 0114(000A)]
If I could ask for your expertise on the matter,\nI would be most grateful.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You see, I recently heard a word whose meaning\nescapes me. I believe it to be some sort of slang.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Tell me, what does “cheugy” mean?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Something super cool
Being outdated and uncool
It’s a really chewy gumball
I see! So one might say, “Today’s lesson was the\ncheugiest!” Is that right?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Ah... I think I understand. For both speaker and\nrecipient, it is not a pleasant word, I take it...[VAR 0114(000A)]
A...very chewy gumball? So it is some sort of\nconfection that children are partial to recently?\c\nI shall have to try one of these “cheugies” for\nmyself sometime.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The words used by young people these days are\nquite often beyond my comprehension.\c\nBut when I learn the meanings behind the words,\nI find that I feel that much closer to my students.[VAR 0114(000A)]

Short styles

Oho! Pompadours, you say? I suspected as much!\c\nThough I don’t seem to recall many of the\nacademy’s male students sporting such a style...[VAR 0114(000A)]

Oh yeah! You’ve started your Treasure Hunt\nthing, right?[VAR 0114(0028)]
Come tell me about anything super interesting\nyou find out there in your adventures![VAR 0114(0028)]

Oh, so you know you’re tough stuff, huh?\nHahaha. But seriously—you look a bit different![VAR 0114(0028)]
What? No, you definitely have...more confidence\nor something![VAR 0114(0028)]
I bet it’s because of all the crazy experiences\nyou’re having on your Treasure Hunt.[VAR 0114(0028)]
You need to tell me all about what you’ve been\nup to![VAR 0114(0028)]
Wooow. That’s super cool![VAR 0114(0028)]
I sure am jealous of you kids. You get to try out\nnew things every single day.[VAR 0114(0028)]
Me, on the other hand...[VAR 0114(0028)]
I actually wanted to become a teacher.[VAR 0114(0028)]
I’m just the school nurse, y’know? I can’t teach\nclasses or anything like that.[VAR 0114(0028)]
I couldn’t pass the certification exam to become\nan actual health teacher.[VAR 0114(0028)]
I took it so many times, but no luck. So here I\nam...stuck forever in the nurse’s office.[VAR 0114(0028)]
Oh, uh...sorry. I guess this isn’t a very fun thing to\ntalk about.[VAR 0114(0028)]
But you’re just such a good listener! I find myself\ntelling you all kinds of stuff.[VAR 0114(0028)]

Did you need something from me?[VAR 0114(0028)]
Are your Pokémon hurt? Just a sec...[VAR 0114(0028)]
Whaaat? But then why’d you come over to talk?\nOh well, I’ll heal up your Pokémon anyway.[VAR 0114(0028)]
Here ya go. A little first aid.[VAR 0114(0028)]
You must really be having an adventure out there,\njudging from those scrapes and cuts![VAR 0114(0028)]
Huh? Oh yeah, I guess it is pretty unusual for me\nto be out of the nurse’s office like this.[VAR 0114(0028)]
Hehe. Well...I’m actually doing a bit of studying.[VAR 0114(0028)]
Thought I’d try my best at the health teacher\ncertification exam one more time.[VAR 0114(0028)]
Wow!
You can do it!
Just so you know, it’s totally NOT because I’m\ninspired by a certain somebody working hard\r\nat their Treasure Hunt, OK?[VAR 0114(0028)]
Well...maybe I am just a little bit![VAR 0114(0028)]
So, y’know...uh...thanks. Yeah. Hehe.[VAR 0114(0028)]

The way you conduct yourself in my class and\nthe answers you give to my questions...[VAR 0114(0027)]
I admit they pique my interest. You are quite the\ninteresting pupil, I must say.[VAR 0114(0027)]

You would answer “new stuff” to me, your history\nteacher? Ha! You really are a curious one.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Ah. So you prefer the things of the past, do you?\nThe potential I saw in you was real after all.[VAR 0114(0027)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Why, if it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)] from\nclass 1-A.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Are you perhaps interested in the rest of the old\ntale I told you in class?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Heh. It is...convenient that you would take the\nbait I presented in class.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Don’t lie to me. Your desire to fulfill your\nintellectual curiosity is made plain as day by that\r\nlook on your face.[VAR 0114(0027)]
A vessel, a sword, a set of tablets, and a set of\nbeads... After obtaining these four treasures, the\r\nking’s castle was destroyed. Why, you ask?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Because these four treasures were actually\nfour Pokémon![VAR 0114(0027)]
As these Pokémon were passed from human hand\nto human hand as treasures, they slowly became\r\ntainted by hubris and greed.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Finally, after coming in contact with the rapacity\nof the king at that time, they awakened as\r\ndisasters and began to rampage out of control.[VAR 0114(0027)]
The king called for renowned Pokémon wielders\nto defend the country and, after a fierce battle,\r\nthese incarnations of disaster were quelled.[VAR 0114(0027)]
It is said that these four Pokémon were then\nsealed away somewhere in Paldea.[VAR 0114(0027)]
So, what do you think? Would you say this story\nis just make-believe?[VAR 0114(0027)]
What?! Where’s your sense of adventure?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Heh...very astute of you.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I have read many historical disaster reports,\npersonal journals, and the like.\c\nThere is much to support the truth of this story.[VAR 0114(0027)]
If I am able to prove the story’s veracity myself,\nI will be sure to let you know.[VAR 0114(0027)]
You became even closer with Ms. Raifort!

[VAR 0100(0000)]! The time has come![VAR 0114(0027)]
The cursed treasures... The four Pokémon of ruin...[VAR 0114(0027)]
They exist![VAR 0114(0027)]
And I stumbled upon the truth in the newspaper,\nof all places! Hah! In an interview piece with a\r\ncarpenter, no less![VAR 0114(0027)]
The Pokémon wielders apparently used sacred\nstakes to seal these treasures of ruin in shrines.[VAR 0114(0027)]
There is a separate shrine for each of the four\nPokémon, and eight stakes driven into the ground\r\nin the areas surrounding each shrine keep the\r\npower of ruin at bay.[VAR 0114(0027)]
In other words, if all of the stakes for a given\nshrine were to be removed...[VAR 0114(0027)]
it would release the Pokémon held inside![VAR 0114(0027)]
Don’t you think it would be nice to free those\nPokémon from the confines of their tiny little\r\nshrines, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Heh. A kind soul, I see. You are proving\ntruly useful![VAR 0114(0027)]
That’s surprisingly heartless of you! Come now—\ndo it for the Pokémon![VAR 0114(0027)]
According to a descendant of the Pokémon\nwielders in the story, you must have a bond with\r\nPokémon in order to remove the stakes.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I’m sure someone as Pokémon savvy as yourself\nwould have no trouble at all with that.[VAR 0114(0027)]
You can choose for yourself whether to believe\nme or not, but I will mark the locations of these\r\nshrines on your map.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I’d rather go myself, of course, but skipping out\non my classes to go adventuring seems to have\r\nmade the director a little suspicious of me...[VAR 0114(0027)]
Heh. You can think of it as part of your Treasure\nHunt. Treasures of ruin are still treasures, after all.\c\nI hope you will investigate these shrines if you are\nat all inclined to do so.[VAR 0114(0027)]
You feel trusted by Ms. Raifort!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : kizuna_history_d.dat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]! Did you find any of\nthe\r\ntreasures\r\nof ruin?[VAR 0114(0027)]
I hope you will investigate the shrines if you are\nat all inclined to do so.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Hm? It seems to me that you don’t have anything\nnew to report on the treasures of ruin...[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh! You caught Ting-Lu, the Vessel of Ruin?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh! You caught Chien-Pao, the Sword of Ruin?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh! You caught Wo-Chien, the Tablets of Ruin?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Oh! You caught Chi-Yu, the Beads of Ruin?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Ohohooo! How interesting! I simply cannot keep\nmy curiosity under control![VAR 0114(0027)]
Judging by its shape and size, this vessel was\nalmost certainly NOT for everyday use.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Perhaps it was a work of art? Or, better yet, a\nritual artifact housing some sort of deity?![VAR 0114(0027)]
I feel that there must be some meaning behind\nthe horns and the designs resembling eyes.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Could it be that this artifact was fashioned after\nthe deity’s very appearance?![VAR 0114(0027)]
So the sword’s blade and hilt form the Pokémon’s\nleft and right fangs![VAR 0114(0027)]
I wonder if the sword broke when it became a\nPokémon... Or perhaps it was always that way?[VAR 0114(0027)]
No, wait—I cannot imagine the king wanting to\nbuy a broken sword.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Maybe it was some sort of weapon that was\nmeant to be used in this “broken” state?![VAR 0114(0027)]
I’ve never seen so many wooden writing tablets\nstrung together! It must have been an epic tale![VAR 0114(0027)]
Most excavated tablets are tantamount to graffiti\nor simple memos—still valuable tools for learning\r\nabout the past, but nothing like this![VAR 0114(0027)]
I can’t read it, but given the length...it must be\na story, yes! Or perhaps the words of a curse...?[VAR 0114(0027)]
If only the words weren’t faded! How frustrating!\nThese wooden tablets piqued the curiosity of a\r\nking! What might have been written on them?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Beads like these were thought to be sacred and\nthus were worn during religious rituals.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I believe they were most often worn as a single\nbead on the neck like a pendant, but it seems\r\nChi-Yu has four of them.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Were the beads worn in pairs, like on the ears\nand wrists? Or were the rituals perhaps\r\nperformed by four people?[VAR 0114(0027)]
What on earth could have caused beads such as\nthese—originally used to ward off disaster—to\r\nbecome bringers of disaster themselves?[VAR 0114(0027)]
This mystery grows ever deeper. Ah! My thirst\nfor knowledge is slowly being quenched![VAR 0114(0027)]
Hm? You look like you have something more to\nreport. What is it?[VAR 0114(0027)]
Seeing part of history with my own eyes fills me\nwith joy. I thank you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
Please come back and report to me again if you\nfind more of the treasures of ruin.[VAR 0114(0027)]
This is simply amazing. You have now reported\nback to me with all four of the treasures of ruin.[VAR 0114(0027)]
I never thought that you would be able to do\nTHIS much for me.[VAR 0114(0027)]
You have my thanks, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
I would have liked to go looking for the treasures\nof ruin myself and make them my own.[VAR 0114(0027)]
But I suppose it was precisely because I sent\nyou—someone with a pure heart—that we were\r\nable to accomplish this feat.[VAR 0114(0027)]
They may be the treasures of my dreams, but I\nwill allow you to have them for now.[VAR 0114(0027)]
Consider this a symbol of my gratitude, too.\nTake it. It is yours.[VAR 0114(0027)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Heh. You truly are an interesting one, aren’t\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]? I hope you\r\ndon’t\r\nmind\r\nif\r\nI\r\ncontinue\r\nto\r\nkeep an eye on you![VAR 0114(0027)]

Are you here to eat as well?[VAR 0114(0029)]
Yep! I’m starving
I just kind of wandered in
Ha! Excellent. You shouldn’t battle on an empty\nstomach.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Drawn in by the irresistible aromas, I imagine.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I myself am here to...survey the student cafeteria,\nlet’s say.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I am observing the nutritional content of the food\nthat our students partake of on a regular basis.[VAR 0114(0029)]
One item on the menu here that I am particularly\ninterested in is the Peanut Butter Sandwich.\r\nIt is sweet and quite delicious.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Yes...perhaps I will order one right now.[VAR 0114(0029)]
Oh look! It’s Mr. Saguaro! He’s so fashionable\nand cool.
I guess the teachers come to the cafeteria too,\nhuh? D’you think he’ll have an Egg Sandwich?
No way! If he gets anything here, it’ll definitely\nbe something spicy, like the Five-Alarm Sandwich!
Ahhh! He’s so cool! He’ll definitely get that wild\nand spicy Five-Alarm Sandwich!
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0029)]
Could I have a...Five-Alarm Sandwich? I do enjoy\nthe thrill of spicy food.[VAR 0114(0029)]
But, Mr. Saguaro! What about...?
No! Have a Peanut Butter Sandwich!
[VAR BD06(0000)]A-ah, yes. You suggested I have a Peanut Butter\nSandwich,\r\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?\r\nI\r\nsuppose\r\nI\r\nshall\r\nhave\r\nto\r\ntry\r\none.\r\nIf\r\nyou insist.[VAR 0114(0029)]
That was close. I almost forced myself to order\nsomething spicy—my least favorite of flavors.[VAR 0114(0029)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I thank you for restraining me,\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
It seems that the students tend to view me as\nfashionable and cool...or even—dare I say it?—\r\nexuding a sort of brooding strength.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I have a habit of acting in such a way so as not to\ndestroy their image of me.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I showed my true colors to you just now without\nthinking. Please keep this as a secret between us.[VAR 0114(0029)]

Well, you see, I do not want anyone to overhear\nthis, but...[VAR 0114(0029)]
I hear rumors of an incredibly sweet condiment\nthat exists somewhere in the Paldea region.[VAR 0114(0029)]

You are the only one who knows of my insatiable\nsweet tooth. Thus, I have no one else I can turn\r\nto for help in this matter.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I cannot go looking for this condiment myself lest\nI destroy the image students have of me.[VAR 0114(0029)]
I will repay you for your troubles, of course.\nGive it some thought if this piques your interest.[VAR 0114(0029)]
In the meantime, I will gather what information I\ncan about this incredibly sweet condiment.[VAR 0114(0029)]

Ah![VAR 0114(0029)]
It smells suuuper sweet! And you looked so\nhappy eating it!
N-no! You see, ah...there is a reason for this![VAR 0114(0029)]

You don’t?! Ahhh! What should I do? What\nshould I do?!\c\nWaouh! Hold on—I had exactly one Potion in\nmy pocket![VAR 0114(0026)]
This’ll fix you right up, my friend! Potion\npower, GO![VAR 0114(0026)]
... ... ...
Phew. That seems to have done the trick just in\nthe nick of time![VAR 0114(0026)]
But this Pawmi doesn’t appear to belong to a\nTrainer. Hmm... Could a wild Pokémon have\r\nwandered onto the academy grounds?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Still, I can’t just leave it here alone without\nanyone to make sure it’s OK.[VAR 0114(0026)]
It’s decided, then! I, Salvatore, will just have to\nlend all of the helping hands I have to take care\r\nof Pawmi in this touch-and-go situation![VAR 0114(0026)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Merci very much for your advice,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0026)]
You became even closer with Mr. Salvatore!
Adios! Au revoir! Farewell![VAR 0114(0026)]

Oh! My dear [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0026)]
Thanks to your advice from before, Pawmi is...\nWell, just see for yourself![VAR 0114(0026)]
... ... ...
Is it feeling better now?
It seems very...quiet?
Hmm...yeah. It’s feeling better, but this particular\nPawmi may just be a bit meek, I suppose?[VAR 0114(0026)]
I had Nurse Miriam take a look as well, and she\nsays there’s nothing wrong with it healthwise![VAR 0114(002A)]
So it shouldn’t have any injuries, ailments, or\nthe like.[VAR 0114(002A)]
... ... ...
Even so, it never utters so much as a cry, which\nis odd.[VAR 0114(0026)]
That part has even Mr. Jacq here stumped.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Sorry that I couldn’t be of any help...[VAR 0114(002A)]
Ne t’inquiète pas! Don’t worry about it![VAR 0114(0026)]
I have some more information now thanks to the\nacademy’s security cameras, though.[VAR 0114(0026)]
It seems Pawmi was attacked by a wild Pokémon\nand fled here to the academy grounds.[VAR 0114(0026)]
Maybe it’s still in a bit of shock from that\nexperience and can’t bring itself to speak yet?[VAR 0114(0026)]
... ... ...
Yep! If that’s the case, there’s absolutely no\nproblem with keeping quiet! Pas de problème![VAR 0114(0026)]
We can just attendre—wait, that is—until it feels\nlike talking! That’s all we can do, really![VAR 0114(0026)]
Even if you can speak all sorts of languages,\nthere’s no guarantee that you can understand\r\nwhat’s going on in someone’s heart.[VAR 0114(0026)]
But have no fear! I won’t give up! No—I’ll keep\non trying until we’ve figured each other out![VAR 0114(0026)]
You feel trusted by Mr. Salvatore!

My dear [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0026)]
Pawmi here is as healthy as can be![VAR 0114(0026)]
... ... ...
Hahaha! Well, it seems being quiet is simply a\npart of this one’s personality![VAR 0114(0026)]
But it’s hard for a Pokémon to communicate with\nits fellows without speaking up.[VAR 0114(0026)]
As you know, wild Pokémon use their cries to tell\neach other all sorts of things—like the location of\r\nfood or whether there are predators nearby.[VAR 0114(0026)]
So even if I were to release it back into the wild,\nI’m afraid that it may not be able to do those\r\nsorts of things![VAR 0114(0026)]
... ... ...
[VAR BD06(0000)]What do you think, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nWhere\r\ndoes\r\nPawmi belong?[VAR 0114(0026)]
How about here?
With you, Mr. Salvatore!
Here? At the academy?[VAR 0114(0026)]
Oh?! I didn’t expect to hear mon nom—my name![VAR 0114(0026)]
So you think it should stay here...with me![VAR 0114(0026)]
I was so focused on getting it back in good\nhealth so it could return to the wild that I didn’t\r\neven consider that possibility![VAR 0114(0026)]
What do you think about that idea, my little\nPawmi friend?[VAR 0114(0026)]
... ... ...
Pawmi!
Pawmi! It spoke! At last![VAR 0114(0026)]
Even without speaking Pokémon language myself,\nI know that that reply means “yes”![VAR 0114(0026)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, my dear [VAR 0100(0000)]! Merci\nso\r\nvery,\r\nvery\r\nmuch\r\nfor\r\nall\r\nyour\r\nhelp\r\nwith Pawmi![VAR 0114(0026)]
All the more reason you should have this—here,\na rare Pokémon for you to raise![VAR 0114(0026)]
You received a Meowth from Mr. Salvatore!
Ahhh, I’m so happy! Yes—I, Salvatore, will take\nit upon myself to look after Pawmi for good!\r\nI will indeed![VAR 0114(0026)]
You formed a close bond with Mr. Salvatore!

[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, my. If it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)].\nHello there.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Do you perhaps have a question about class?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Yes, I have a question!
All good! No questions!
What were you having trouble with? Let’s have a\nlittle review here, shall we?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Hahaha. I’m glad to hear it! Then perhaps you\nwon’t mind a little quiz.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Flying-type Pokémon are weak to Rock-type\nmoves.\c\nWhen a Rock-type move hits a Flying-type\nPokémon, what becomes of the move’s damage?[VAR 0114(0025)]
It stays the same
It’s doubled
It’s multiplied by 100
Yes, that’s right! The correct answer is that the\nmove’s damage is doubled.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh dear. The correct answer is that the move’s\ndamage is doubled. But I appreciate you trying![VAR 0114(0025)]
Ms. Tyme! Ms. Tyyyyyyme!
Oh, my. I see one of my more energetic students\nis here to see me. You’ll have to wait your turn,\r\ndear! There is only one of me, after all.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Um, Ms. Tyme? Is it true that you were a Gym\nLeader?!
That is indeed true. I’m quite the strong battler,\nyou know![VAR 0114(0025)]
Wow! That’s so cool! Why’d you quit?
So you want to know, do you? I might be\npersuaded to tell you if you wait your turn.[VAR 0114(0025)]
OK! I can wait my turn! I sure can!
[VAR BD06(0000)]I’m sorry for cutting our conversation short,\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\nbut\r\nI\r\nseem\r\nto\r\nbe\r\nin\r\nhigh\r\ndemand today.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Feel free to come see me any time if you have\nquestions for me.[VAR 0114(0025)]
You became slightly closer with Ms. Tyme!

Oh, my. If it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0025)]
Please forgive me if this is an...odd question.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Were you perhaps watching me from afar\njust now?[VAR 0114(0025)]
No, I wasn’t
I just got here
Y-yes, I suppose you wouldn’t have been doing\nsomething like that. I’m sorry.[VAR 0114(0025)]
You see... Oh, how should I put this?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Recently, there have been times when I feel as if\nI am being watched...[VAR 0114(0025)]
Not by a Pokémon, mind you, but by a person.[VAR 0114(0025)]
I thought it might be a ghost, so I tried asking my\nsister for help. She said it most likely isn’t one.\r\nShe’s good with Ghost-type Pokémon, you know.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Perhaps one of my students is quietly watching\nme, waiting for a chance to ask me a question?[VAR 0114(0025)]
That might be it
Hmmm. Maybe?
Goodness, if that wasn’t an intense gaze I felt!\nIf you notice someone with a sort of fire in their\r\neyes, come tell me, won’t you?[VAR 0114(0025)]
If they are too shy to come ask me themselves,\nthen I’ll go to them![VAR 0114(0025)]
You became even closer with Ms. Tyme!

Text File : kizuna_math_c.dat

[VAR 0100(0000)]?! You scared me![VAR 0114(0025)]
Are you here to eat?
Were you cooking something?
Oh, no! I’m not here for anything food-related\nat all![VAR 0114(0025)]
I was just walking around the entrance hall...[VAR 0114(0025)]
and I felt that intense gaze that I told you\nabout before![VAR 0114(0025)]
So I quickly ducked into the cafeteria here.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Our cafeteria has only one entrance, so I thought\nI might be able to discover the identity of the\r\nperson watching me if they followed me in here![VAR 0114(0025)]
Ah! Someone’s come just now![VAR 0114(0025)]
Huh? That’s weird...I thought I saw her come\nin here.
I guess I won’t be able to ask my question today,\neither...
That girl...I feel like I’ve seen her several times\nbefore.[VAR 0114(0025)]
She seems to be a student here, but I get the\nfeeling that her question is not about her studies.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Next time I see her, maybe I’ll go start up a\nconversation myself![VAR 0114(0025)]
It could have been a little scary being here on my\nown. I’m glad you were here with me.[VAR 0114(0025)]
You feel trusted by Ms. Tyme!

[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]! Help me keep an eye\nout,\r\nwould you?[VAR 0114(0025)]
I’ve set up a little ambush here for that girl who\nkeeps watching me! She’ll be here any second![VAR 0114(0025)]
An ambush?!
Why?!
Well, you see, it’s not very pleasant knowing\nshe’s just staring at me all the time.[VAR 0114(0025)]
And now I know what she looks like after seeing\nher in the cafeteria![VAR 0114(0025)]
Ah![VAR 0114(0025)]
It’s you, isn’t it?! You’re the one who’s been\nsecretly watching me recently![VAR 0114(0025)]
T-Tyme?! How’d you know I—
I guess you must have noticed me... I-I’m so sorry!
Well, of course I noticed—you were watching me\npractically all day every day, after all!\c\nI assume there’s something you want to ask me?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Y-yes...I do.
I’ve been a huge fan of yours since your time as\na Gym Leader! And I love Rock-type moves so\r\nvery much!
Oh, my...[VAR 0114(0025)]
But you just suddenly retired from your post as\nGym Leader a year and a half ago...\c\nWhy did you quit?!
My goodness... Is that all you wanted to ask?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Yes. Your reason for retiring was never\nmade public...
but it’s well known among the students here that\nyou just avoid the question any time it’s asked.
I thought it would be rude to ask you a question\nthat you don’t want to answer...so I just couldn’t\r\nfind the courage to ask.
So that’s why your gaze felt so very intense. I see.\nForgive me.[VAR 0114(0025)]
So very...intense?
Ah, never mind that. As for the reason I quit my\njob as Gym Leader, I simply wanted to focus\r\nmore on my job as a teacher.[VAR 0114(0025)]
It’s not that I disliked being a Gym Leader or\nanything of that sort.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Quite the contrary—talking about the Gym fills\nme with feelings of nostalgia and sadness.[VAR 0114(0025)]
That’s why I always avoid answering the question\nwhen students ask.[VAR 0114(0025)]
Oh. I see...
Do you have any plans of becoming a Gym\nLeader again?
No, I’m afraid I don’t plan to do so.[VAR 0114(0025)]
My sister is doing a splendid job as Gym Leader\nin my stead.[VAR 0114(0025)]
I personally find being a teacher most enjoyable\nthese days.[VAR 0114(0025)]
But since I am, in fact, your teacher...I would\nappreciate it if you would call me “Ms. Tyme,”\r\nas students do, and not just “Tyme.”[VAR 0114(0025)]
OK. I’m sad to hear that, but I understand!
Thank you so much, Ms. Tyme!
Well, I suppose that solves the mystery![VAR 0114(0025)]
Ahhh, that made me so nervous! I said so many\nthings to try to sound cool![VAR 0114(0025)]
I was certainly a little scared when I felt that girl’s\nintense gaze on me.[VAR 0114(0025)]
But having you here with me allowed me to do\nwhat needed to be done to face what turned out\r\nto be one of my biggest fans.[VAR 0114(0025)]
I must thank you for always showing up at just the\nright time, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
Allow me to show you my appreciation a little.\nI hope these help on your adventure.[VAR 0114(0025)]
You formed a close bond with Ms. Tyme!

Sure!
Well...

Pfft, haha! You kidder, pretending like you’re not\nitching to battle! C’mon, let’s get down to it.[VAR 0114(0004)]
You spent two whole hours battling Pokémon\nwith Nemona!
Ahhh, good stuff![VAR 0114(0004)]
Gotta step up my game so I’ll be ready anytime\nfor that Academy Ace Tournament![VAR 0114(0004)]

Yep, that’s me![VAR 0114(0004)]
Ah hah hah...hah. Yeeeah. Maybe some\nother time.
[VAR 0100(0000)]! Hola![VAR 0114(0004)]
Who was that?
Friend of yours?
Oh, him? Dunno who he was![VAR 0114(0004)]
I was just munching my sandwich and I heard him\nbragging about his tough Pokémon, so I invited\r\nhim to battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
I wonder what Pokémon he’s gonna use?\nCan’t wait to see![VAR 0114(0004)]
Wait, I forgot to get his contact info! How are we\nsupposed to plan when we’ll face off?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh well. I’ll make sure we battle next time I run\ninto him![VAR 0114(0004)]

Oh my gosh, listen to this. Remember that guy\nfrom the cafeteria?[VAR 0114(0004)]
I ran into him again in the entrance hall, so I\nasked him to battle...but he said no![VAR 0114(0004)]
He was like, “What’s the point? You’re a\nChampion and a battle whiz—you’d wreck me!”[VAR 0114(0004)]
I don’t get what he meant! I mean, you can have\nfun battling even if you lose, right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Yeah, you can
Winning’s nice, though...
For real! I mean, sure, no one loves losing, but\nit’s definitely not pointless. It teaches you stuff![VAR 0114(0004)]
Yeeeah, I guess so... Obviously I’d rather win than\nlose, but I just think it’s better to go into things\r\nwith a “losing can be fun, too” attitude![VAR 0114(0004)]
Man... Pokémon battles can get so complicated\nsometimes.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, and I wish he hadn’t called me a whiz!\nI work hard at this stuff. It’s not like it all just\r\ncomes naturally to me![VAR 0114(0004)]
Like, throwing Poké Balls obviously doesn’t come\nnaturally to me, for one thing...[VAR 0114(0004)]
I think I need a mental reset. I’m gonna go find\nsomeone to battle![VAR 0114(0004)]

Well, now that I’ve found you, we should swing\nby my room and have a chat![VAR 0114(0004)]

It’s so tidy!
It’s very you!
Aw, thank— Wait a sec... I know we’ve been to\nYOUR room before...[VAR 0114(0004)]
But have I never had you over here? Wild![VAR 0114(0004)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Anyway, uh... Listen, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nYou\r\nknow\r\nhow\r\nI, well...[VAR 0114(0004)]
You know how I really like Pokémon battles?\nLike, really, REALLY like ’em?[VAR 0114(0004)]
Yeah, you sure do
I noticed
Cool. And yeah, you know how when you really\nlike something, you dive in deep?[VAR 0114(0004)]
That’s what I did with Pokémon battles, and I...\njust kinda became a Champion?[VAR 0114(0004)]
But then I found out that’s pretty special—that\nnormally, it’s not so simple for most people.[VAR 0114(0004)]
People would tell me to my face that I’d only\nmanaged it ’cause I have some innate gift, or\r\n’cause I was raised differently, or whatever.[VAR 0114(0004)]
And suddenly I started to feel like there was this\ninvisible wall between me and everyone else.[VAR 0114(0004)]
So I started going easy when I’d battle my\nfriends. I just wanted everyone to have fun.[VAR 0114(0004)]
Oh, but don’t worry, I’m not doing that anymore!\nI’m going 100-percent all out![VAR 0114(0004)]
Especially since I’m lucky enough to have an\nopponent around who can beat me even when\r\nI’m in full hard-core mode![VAR 0114(0004)]

Oof, that got pretty personal! Little bit\nembarrassed over here...[VAR 0114(0004)]
Anyway! Since we’re equals, I gotta start having\nyou over as much as we hang out in your room![VAR 0114(0004)]

Yeah, exactly! That’s my little know-it-all buddy!\nGot a mind like a steel trap, eh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
What?! Come on, I gave you [VAR 0101(0001)]’s\nPoké Ball! Did I forget to introduce myself...?[VAR 0114(0006)]

Whole school seems to be talking about you.\c\nThe new kid who showed up with the president\nof the student council.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I normally wouldn’t even bother showing up for\nclass, but I came all the way to school today\r\njust to talk with you—our new celebrity.[VAR 0114(0006)]
You’ve gotta help me out so I can finally make\nmy dream a reality![VAR 0114(0006)]
Happy to help!
What’s this dream, first?
What kind of little maniac says yes to something\nwithout even knowing what they’re agreeing to?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Hehehe... Caught your interest, have I? You want\nto hear all about my dream, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, this might come as a surprise, but fact is,\nI’m all about that picnic life: the great outdoors,\r\nthe perfectly prepared sandwiches, all of it.\c\nNot half bad at cooking either, I can tell you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Right now I’m researching new recipes that’ll help\nPokémon feel better. Real health food, see.[VAR 0114(0006)]
I found this book the other day, and it had a\nsection about these Herba Mystica things...[VAR 0114(0006)]
Basically, they’re some kind of special herbs that\nheal up any Pokémon as soon as it eats them![VAR 0114(0006)]
Now, there are a total of five different types of\nHerba Mystica, based on what I read.\c\nJust taking a little lick of them once they’ve been\npowdered will get your blood flowing, provide\r\nnutrients, prevent aging—it’ll even boost the\r\nimmune system![VAR 0114(0006)]
These herbs seem like they’re the real deal.\nOnly found here in Paldea—and rare to boot![VAR 0114(0006)]
But this book says they’re all guarded by Titan\nPokémon, meaning that it’s gonna be pretty\r\ntough to try to grab even a few sprigs.[VAR 0114(0006)]
’Cause, see, Titans are— Well, I think they’ve\ngotta be...things like this![VAR 0114(0006)]
I really want to get those herbs for myself, but...\nI’m not very good at Pokémon battles.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Don’t have any friends with strong Pokémon to\nlend me a hand, either...\c\nAnd I’d never hear the end of it if I went crawling\nto that student council girl...[VAR 0114(0006)]
But here you waltz up! You’ve got to help me out\nwith this—you’d be perfect![VAR 0114(0006)]
Nope! Wait! I don’t need an answer yet![VAR 0114(0006)]
I’ll just register the places where it seems there\nmight be Titans in your map app for you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Let it stew a bit, and we can get more into the\ndetails later. And in the meantime...take this.\r\nA little gift for listening and all.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Give the idea some serious thought! Please![VAR 0114(0006)]

Nice try, but I know for a fact you’ve already\ncrossed paths with them.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Great. I appreciate you being up-front here.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Team Star is a group of troublemakers formed by\nsome academy students a while back...[VAR 0114(0009)]
They cause headaches for the school and try to\nbring other students down to their level.[VAR 0114(0009)]
And I refuse to sit idly by and let them get away\nwith it![VAR 0114(0009)]
So I’ve come up with a plan to bring down Team\nStar and force them to disband for good.\c\nI call it...Operation Starfall![VAR 0114(0009)]
But I’ll need allies to carry out this operation...\nand I’d like you to be one of them.[VAR 0114(0009)]
No need to reply right this second. We can\ndiscuss the details some other time.\c\nTill then, I’ll leave you to it. Bye.[VAR 0114(0009)]

And I’ll even give you a badge—y’know, as a\nthank-you for taking on that Titan Pokémon.\c\nI call it a Titan Badge. Made it myself, using a\nreplica of the Gym Badges, see?[VAR 0114(0006)]

Agia!
Whoa! I can’t believe it! The power of these\nherbs really is worth guarding![VAR 0114(0006)]
If they had that big an effect on your Pokémon,\nthen I bet—[VAR 0114(0006)]
Uhhh... I bet it’ll come in super handy for that\nTreasure Hunt assignment we’ve got!\c\nYup! That’s what I bet![VAR 0114(0006)]

It’s this book full of crazy stories and legends\nand things—stuff nobody’d usually believe.[VAR 0114(0006)]
But I believe it! I think what it says is true![VAR 0114(0006)]
And according to this book, eating all five Herba\nMystica can cure anything that ails you![VAR 0114(0006)]
Case in point, Mabosstiff’s paws were cold as ice\nbefore he ate that last herb. But they’ve warmed\r\nup a little now—I’m sure they have![VAR 0114(0006)]
... ... ...
Oh! You done eating, bud?[VAR 0114(0006)]
... ... ...
H-hey! Mabosstiff! Can...can you see? Are your\neyes open?![VAR 0114(0006)]
Yes! I did it![VAR 0114(0006)]
It...it’s been so long since he was able to open his\neyes! I was so worried...[VAR 0114(0006)]

I’m gonna bring Mabosstiff back to full health,\nI swear it![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh...uh, yeah. So, that’s my story.[VAR 0114(0006)]
Three herbs to go. Let’s find ’em—together![VAR 0114(0006)]

Come on out, Mabosstiff. Got some for you,\ntoo, bud.[VAR 0114(0006)]
... ... ...
That’s it. Small bites, small bites...[VAR 0114(0006)]
*chomp chomp* *snarf* *chomp*
Agiaaas!
[VAR 0101(0001)] will be able to dash now!
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)] will be able to jump\nhigher now!
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)] will be able to glide now!
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0101(0001)] will be able to move across the\nwater now!

C’mon... At least bother to taste it before you\nswallow it right down, would you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Agia!
This brute seems to be benefiting from the herbs\ntoo, I guess—in its own sorta way.[VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh yeah! ’Fore I forget,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\r\nTake\r\nanother\r\nlook\r\nat\r\nthis.[VAR 0114(0006)]
There’s always a Titan Pokémon near the Herba\nMystica when we find ’em, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
Like the book says, it’s not like big ol’ Pokémon\njust happen to like these herbs.\c\nIt’s actually something in the herbs that’s making\nthe Titans so big and strong.[VAR 0114(0006)]
So does that mean a Titan’s “lair” isn’t really\nsome kind of treasure hoard or whatever?\r\nIt’s just a pantry where the Titan keeps its food?[VAR 0114(0006)]
... ... ...
Oh. You done with your sandwich, Mabosstiff?[VAR 0114(0006)]

Right? I’m not imagining things![VAR 0114(0006)]
No! No, no, no, no, no! I’m sure I heard it!\nYou must’ve heard it too!\c\nSure you don’t need to get your ears checked?[VAR 0114(0006)]
...Ruff!
See! See that! I knew I wasn’t just hearing things![VAR 0114(0006)]
Oh, Mabosstiff! Who’s my best bud, huh?\nWho’s the best of boys? You are, yes, you are![VAR 0114(0006)]
*sniff*\nIt’s...it’s been so long since I heard that woof![VAR 0114(0006)]
Mabosstiff is definitely getting better![VAR 0114(0006)]
Ever since I teamed up with you, good things\nkeep happening![VAR 0114(0006)]
But we’ve still got two more herbs to go.\nHope you’ll stick it out until we’re done![VAR 0114(0006)]

It says here that the [VAR FF00(0006)]Sweet Herba Mystica[VAR FF00(0000)] is good\nfor gut health and that it helps aid digestion.\c\nSays it’s great for stomachaches, too, or when\nyou want to stimulate the ol’ appetite![VAR 0114(0006)]
Well, apparently [VAR FF00(0006)]Salty Herba Mystica[VAR FF00(0000)] helps with\naching hands and feet. Good for neuropathy and\r\nnumbness.\c\nWhen you’ve got muscle weakness, it supposedly\nbuilds up strength again![VAR 0114(0006)]
[VAR FF00(0006)]Bitter Herba Mystica[VAR FF00(0000)]’s great for your circulation!\nIt really gets the blood flowing!\c\nAnd that warms you right up, nice and toasty,\neven boosting the immune system!\c\n...Or so it says.[VAR 0114(0006)]
OK, [VAR FF00(0006)]Sour Herba Mystica[VAR FF00(0000)] is chock-full of nutrients\nand is great for boosting your overall health!\c\nSays here it works wonders whether you’re tired\nphysically or mentally. Perks you right up![VAR 0114(0006)]

I’ve read about it in books before...\c\nA mental scar. Like psychological trauma,\nyou know? I think that’s what you call it.[VAR 0114(0006)]

I’d say make for the lair of the Flying-type Titan!\c\nThink you might be up to seeking out the\nso-called Open Sky Titan?
I’d say make for the lair of the Ground-type Titan!\c\nDo you dare seek out the Pokémon that has been\ncalled the Quaking Earth Titan?
I’d say make for the lair of the Dragon-type Titan!\c\nWhy not seek out the Pokémon called the\nFalse Dragon Titan?
It’d be the base of Team Star’s Fairy crew!\c\nOrtega, the boss of the Ruchbah Squad, would\nprobably welcome a challenge, from what I hear.
It’d be the base of Team Star’s Dark crew!\c\nI hear Giacomo, the boss of the Segin Squad,\nis just waiting for someone to battle.
It’d be the base of Team Star’s Fire crew!\c\nSeems like Mela, the boss of the Schedar Squad,\nis burning for someone to battle against.
It’d be the base of Team Star’s Poison crew!\c\nAtticus, the boss of the Navi Squad, is apparently\nwaiting for someone to battle.
It’d be the base of Team Star’s Fighting crew!\c\nI’m pretty sure Eri, the boss of the Caph Squad,\ncould use a good challenge in battle.
Go to Area Zero in the Great Crater of Paldea!\c\nI think you’ve got some tried-and-true friends\nwaiting for you there.
I’ll go ahead and mark the spot in your map app\nfor you.
You’ve got a destination set in your map app\nalready. Is it OK if I replace it with this one?
All right...you’re all set! Go out there and have\nan adventure—we’ll be here when you need us!
All righty—I’ll leave your map be! Have fun\nexploring, and we’ll be here when you need us!
Feliz cumpleaños! Congratulations on your\nbirthday!\c\nI do hope you keep visiting the Pokémon Center\nfor many years to come!\c\nNow, are you here to let your Pokémon rest?
[~ 45]
Happy birthday, [VAR 0100(0000)]!
I do hope this will be a wonderful year for you—\neach and every day!
Oh, today is a special day, isn’t it?\c\nI know it’s actually a day early, but we wish you\na very happy birthday!
First, let’s restore your Pokémon to full health.
Be sure to visit a Pokémon Center whenever your\nPokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare running low on HP.\c\nAnd if you’re planning to go far off the beaten\npath, you should probably remember to stock\r\nup on Potions from the Poké Mart, too.\c\nGood luck out there, Trainer!
Your Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare all happy and healthy again!\nGood luck out there, and take care!
Study hard and play hard, that’s what I say!\nYou should enjoy your days as a student.[VAR 0114(002B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, good to have you home,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYour Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare looking a bit weary, though.\nWhy don’t you have a nice rest together?\c\n... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(002B)]
There you are! A nice long nap is all a body\nneeds to feel ready for more adventure, right?\c\nDoesn’t matter whether you’re a person or a\nPokémon—we all need to take time to rest.[VAR 0114(002B)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]Certainly! Allow me to get your birthday\nregistered in our system,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!
Now, do be careful you enter it right. You can’t\nchange your birthday after it’s registered.
So I’ve got here a birthday of [VAR 0201(0001)]/[VAR 0201(0002)] for one\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]. Is that right?
That’s right!
Let me change it
Never mind
Thanks for registering your birthday with the\nPokémon Center!
You should stop by on your big day, too!\nWe’ll be expecting you on [VAR 0201(0001)]/[VAR 0201(0002)]!
Oh, and if your very special birthday isn’t on the\ncalendar this year, then please come on 2/28!
Oh! By the way—did you know...?
Or did you already know that? Well, I do hope\nmy little tidbits come in handy!
With all the little tidbits that I’ve shared with you\nso far, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nyou should now know just about everything you\nneed as you go adventuring!\c\nFlip back through your Adventure Guide from\ntime to time, though, as you enjoy exploring!
Now that you have a Hall of Fame Badge,\nI’ve unlocked the Judge function for you.

There’re more books than I can read in a lifetime.\nBoy, am I ever glad I came to this school!
I feel like I can grow stronger if I sign up for\nbattle studies!
You know, you can get a lot of battle tips from\nMs. Tyme’s math class too.
I really like language class! It doesn’t have too\nmuch to do with Pokémon, though...
[~ 4]
Occulture is such a weird magazine! It’s just full\nof utter nonsense!
[~ 6]
[~ 7]
[~ 8]
Don’t think I’ve ever seen a school where the\nentrance was also the library!
[~ 10]
I’m pretty good at Pokémon battles but I have\ntrouble studying...\c\nThink you can help me prep for our next exam?
I’m really good at my studies, but Pokémon\nbattles are another story...\c\nDo you think you can help me become stronger?
[~ 13]
There’s a book about the Herba Mystica—I know\nthere is—but where could it be...?
[~ 15]
Hey, did you know that this school was\nestablished 805 years ago?
[~ 17]
[~ 18]
[~ 19]
Isn’t it impressive? Everyone here is here to study!
Are you going for the STEM track? Or maybe\nthe humanities track? If you’re into Pokémon,\r\nthen the general studies track might be good?
[~ 22]
[~ 23]
[~ 24]
[~ 25]
[~ 26]
I’m from a small town called Alfornada! There’s\nso many people here at the school!
[~ 28]

I heard it’s easier to find where I’m going if I look\nit up on the computer. Is that true?

[~ 38]
There’s this girl named Penny in the STEM track.\nShe’s smart and really good with machines.\c\nI heard she’s started coming to school again.
Reading out loud from your textbook gets your\nears and mouth in on the learning!
I joined the school because I wanted to learn\nabout Pokémon, but now I’m getting interested\r\nin the STEM track too!
Bug types eat grass—that’s why they’re strong\nagainst Grass types!
I asked so many questions that the teacher\nlearned my name on the first day!
So between a Super Potion and a Hyper Potion,\nwhich one heals your Pokémon more?
Have you heard of Team Star? They were a big\nproblem around here—but that was a while ago.
[~ 46]
I’m telling you—I’m not a teacher, I’m a student!\nI’m wearing the uniform, aren’t I?!
Steel-type moves are super effective against\nFairy-type Pokémon... Did I get that right?
It’s so hard to figure out the type matchups of\nPokémon with two types...
It’s great that night classes are available here.\nI can work during the day and still learn!
I stay up late at night because it seems like a\nwaste to let the day end early...but then I regret\r\nit the next morning.
I saw a Pokémon drop a coin. I kept the coin so\nI could give it back, but the Pokémon was so tiny\r\nthat I haven’t been able to find it since.
[~ 53]

[~ 56]
[~ 57]
They say there are some Pokémon that’ll evolve\nif you have them walk with you for a long time.
[~ 59]
[~ 60]
[~ 61]
The school is so mysterious at night! You meet\ncompletely different people than during the day!\c\nDid you know that outside towns, different\nPokémon come out at night too?
[~ 63]
It’s an honor to be able to study here at the\nalma mater of a famous professor.
[~ 65]
[~ 66]
This kid Arven in my class seems like he’s been\nhaving a rough time since, like, last year. I know\r\nhow hard it must be for him.

I hear you beat Grusha and earned yourself a\nGym Badge! Way to go!
Now don’t you worry—you’re still free to enjoy\nthe snowy slopes here on Glaseado Mountain\r\neven now that you’ve beaten the Gym.
Want to try your hand at the Snow Slope Run?
Which course will you go for?
The Powder Snow Course it is! Have yourself an\neasy-breezy slide down the mountain!
The Blizzard Course! Copy that! Try to keep your\nfocus sharp all the way down!
The Sheer Cold Course, eh? Quite a challenge,\nto be sure! Good luck out there, kid!
You’ll need to ride a Pokémon down one of\nGlaseado Mountain’s natural snowy slopes...\r\nThat’s all there is to it!
Choose one of three possible courses and reach\nits finish line within the target time, and you\r\nmight just earn yourself a nice prize!
Have fun, give it your all, and see if you can\nkeep beating your personal bests!
Your best times, eh? Let’s see...
That’d be [VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)].[VAR 0201(0002)] on the Powder Snow Course.
As for the Blizzard Course, your best time is\n[VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)].[VAR 0201(0002)]!
And for the Sheer Cold Course, your best time is\n[VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)].[VAR 0201(0002)]!
Hmm... You haven’t reached the goal on the\nPowder Snow Course yet.
As for the Blizzard Course, you still need to\ncomplete that one.
And for the Sheer Cold Course? Yeah, you need\nto reach the goal before you can get a best time!
Yeah! I’m ready to go!
What are the rules?
What are my best times?
Never mind
Powder Snow Course
Blizzard Course
Sheer Cold Course
Well done on your first time completing the\nPowder Snow Course! Here—this prize is for you!
From now on, you’ll be able to take on the\nBlizzard Course when you feel up to it!\c\nCareful though—it’s pretty tough!
You completed a full run on the Blizzard Course\nfor the first time! Now you’re practically a pro!\r\nHere—this prize is for you!
From now on, you’ll be able to take on the\nSheer Cold Course—our toughest slope of all!\r\nCome back and give it a go if you dare!
You completed the Sheer Cold Course for the\nfirst time! You’re a snow-slope master now!\r\nHere, take this prize. You’ve earned it!

The slopes weren’t your friend that time, eh?\nYour next try will be better, I’m sure!
Oh? It seems the Pokémon you’ll be riding is\ncurrently in its battle form.\c\nIf you want to take on the Snow Slope Run, your\nPokémon needs to change into its ride form first.

You want to know if your Pokémon have really\nbeen giving it their best effort?
Which of your Pokémon’s efforts do you want\nto check?
OK! Then I’ll have a look at how much effort\n[VAR 0102(0001)]’s been putting in!
Hmmm... Uh huh... Oh my...\nOoh... Wow, that much?!
Hmmm... I see...\nAhhh... Oh, yes, OK...
Wow, [VAR 0102(0001)]...\c\nYou’ve really worked hard! Here, I’ll give you\nsomething to show you’ve put in a lot of effort!
It looks like it can still give a bit more!
[VAR 0102(0001)] got an Effort Ribbon!
Your Pokémon’s clearly earned that Effort\nRibbon. It looks great!
Oh, that’s too bad...
Pokémon work real hard when they battle.\c\nThe more battles they take part in, the more\ntheir efforts stack up!

Hey, I can put any Pokémon that’s Lv. 50 or\nhigher through Hyper Training, if you’d like!
Whaddya say? Do you want one of your\nPokémon to go through Hyper Training?
So, which Pokémon d’you want me to\nHyper Train?
Maybe another time, then...
Huh? Sorry, kid, but it looks like you don’t have\nany Bottle Caps or Gold Bottle Caps.
Your Pokémon can’t withstand Hyper Training\nunless they’ve reached Lv. 50.
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0102(0001)] is so strong, it doesn’t\nneed\r\nHyper\r\nTraining.
Do you want to use Bottle Caps or a Gold\nBottle Cap?
A Gold Bottle Cap (You have: [VAR 0201(0002)])
Bottle Caps (You have: [VAR 0201(0003)])
Never mind
So you want me to raise all of its stats?
Which stat do you want me to raise?
Hope you’re ready. Let’s get to Hyper Training!
That stat is so high, it doesn’t need Hyper\nTraining.
[~ 15]
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0102(0001)]’s Hyper Training is\ncomplete...\r\nIt’s\r\nbecome\r\nstronger!
Do you want to continue Hyper Training?

Welcome. They’ll take your order at the front.
Hey, it’s you—the student who beat Larry! That\nwas some fine battling!
You’re something, kid. I’ll let you in on a special\ndish I only make for my favorite customers—\r\none that changes a Pokémon’s Tera Type!
I just need these special ingredients called Tera\nShards. Whenever you get your mitts on ’em,\r\ncome let me know!\c\nSince you’re a first-timer, I’ll give you enough to\nchange a Pokémon’s Tera Type to Normal!
Brought me some Tera Shards so I can whip up a\nTera Type-changing dish?
I brought Normal Tera Shards
I brought Fire Tera Shards
I brought Water Tera Shards
I brought Electric Tera Shards
I brought Grass Tera Shards
I brought Ice Tera Shards
I brought Fighting Tera Shards
I brought Poison Tera Shards
I brought Ground Tera Shards
I brought Flying Tera Shards
I brought Psychic Tera Shards
I brought Bug Tera Shards
I brought Rock Tera Shards
I brought Ghost Tera Shards
I brought Dragon Tera Shards
I brought Dark Tera Shards
I brought Steel Tera Shards
I brought Fairy Tera Shards
How does this work?
Not now, thanks
I’ll need 50 Tera Shards for the special dish...\nbut it seems you’re a bit short! Sorry, kid!
It works like this: I make a special dish that your\nPokémon can eat to change its Tera Type!\c\nI need 50 Tera Shards to make the dish, though.\nIt’s up to you to gather ’em for me!
Which Pokémon are you lookin’ to feed this to?

Lately, I’ve found a coin or two lying around.\nPerhaps folks have more than they can hold onto.
I picked up a coin while I was cleaning. Had a\nfeeling it was yours—here you go.

Hoho! Hello there, child! I am a collector of\ncuriosities and a great lover of [VAR 0101(0001)].
I’ve an auspicious curio to offer—if you’ll trade\nme [VAR 0201(0003)] [VAR 1001][VAR 0109(0002)] for it.
[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, it seems you haven’t got enough, child.\nWhy don’t you find some [VAR 0101(0001)] to\r\nbattle?\r\nYou\r\ncan\r\nacquire\r\n[VAR 1001][VAR 0109(0002)]\r\nfrom them.
Hoho! Very good, very good. I feel closer than\never to [VAR 0101(0001)] now!
Here’s the curio I promised you. Take good care\nof it—it’s laden with blessings.
Wait—I’m afraid you can’t carry any more sets\nof Auspicious Armor than you’ve already got.
Ehehe! Hello there, child! I am a collector of\ncuriosities and a great lover of [VAR 0101(0001)].
I’ve a curio with a...dark past, shall we say. It’s\nyours for [VAR 0201(0003)] [VAR 1001][VAR 0109(0002)].
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’ll need more than that, child. If you battle\nsome [VAR 0101(0001)], they may drop the\r\n[VAR 1001][VAR 0109(0002)]\r\nyou need.
Ehehe! That will do nicely. I feel more connected\nwith [VAR 0101(0001)] now!

Oh, hi. This is a home for Team Star dropouts.
... ... ...\nOperation Starfall? You’ve declared war?\c\nThat’s not really any of our business. It’s not like\nwe talk to the folks in charge.
Anyway, thanks for coming. Haven’t really got\nmuch to welcome a guest with, but...here.
You got the [VAR FF00(0008)]Sporty Cap (Star)[VAR FF00(0000)]!
You can stay and hang here however long you\nlike. If you need to get going, that’s fine too!
This is a home for Team Star dropouts.
We just got tired of Team Star stuff, y’know?\nWe’ve even started going to school on the sly.
Nice to meet ya! And when you go, like always...\nHasta la vistaaarrr! ☆
No one fights here. That’s why it’s such a nice\nplace—better than school, better than with Team\r\nStar, better than home...

My, my—I sense great depths to your past.\nYou must have seen much in lives gone by.
I can study your Rotom Phone to peer into past\nlives you’ve lived. I call it Rotometry! Care to try?
Hm, perhaps we’d best leave it alone after all.\nI can sense your suspicion of me...
Ahhh, your past... It drifts before my eyes! I see a\nlife you once lived in— Oh, where is this...?
Kanto?
Galar?
Sinnoh?
Hisui?
I’m good, actually...
Yes, yes! It’s coming into clearer focus! In this\nprevious life, you once tread the grounds of...
Kanto! I see you and a beloved Pokémon on an\nadventure in the Kanto region, urging each other\r\nonward with a bold “Let’s go!”
Galar! I see you facing down enormous\nchallenges in the Galar region with equally\r\nenormous Dynamax Pokémon at your side!
Sinnoh! I see you digging beneath the surface\nof the Sinnoh region itself and dazzling crowds\r\nin Super Contest Shows!
Hisui! I see you braving a great adventure in the\nHisui region, an odd phone gripped in your hand!\r\nWait—where is “Hisui”? I’ve never heard of it...
Allow me to fashion for your Rotom Phone a case\nthat befits your memories.
Aaand...there!
Your case is finished. Carry it proudly!
You got the [VAR FF00(0008)]Pika-Vee case[VAR FF00(0000)]!
You got the [VAR FF00(0008)]Ball Guy case[VAR FF00(0000)]!
You got the [VAR FF00(0008)]Pokétch case[VAR FF00(0000)]!
You got the [VAR FF00(0008)]Arc Phone case[VAR FF00(0000)]!
If you wish to plumb your memories for more\npast lives, come speak to me again.
Never have I met one who has lived so widely\nas you! I’m honored to have divined your past.
I hope your Rotom Phone cases serve you well.\nMay your past lives live on in them.

I sure am proud to have one of my students\nbecome the academy’s ace![VAR 0114(002A)]
Ahem! Mr. Jacq![VAR 0114(000A)]
Ah, don’t worry, Director Clavell. I’ll get to the\npoint now.[VAR 0114(002A)]

We’re getting report after report from academy\nstudents about their Pokémon getting injured.[VAR 0114(002A)]

If I can find the time...
Woo-hoo! Thank you![VAR 0114(002A)]
Your Pokédex automatically records the data we\nneed as you go, so don’t worry about that![VAR 0114(002A)]
For now, I’d like you to just take on a lot of these\ntough Tera Raid Battles![VAR 0114(002A)]
But don’t get in over your head. Even the\nacademy’s ace needs to be careful![VAR 0114(002A)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Our investigation is moving along thanks to you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]—we have some new data.[VAR 0114(002A)]
It seems that Terastal energy is released from\nthe Great Crater of Paldea from time to time,\r\nand that’s having an effect on the crystals.[VAR 0114(002A)]
Tera Raid crystals that get hit by especially strong\nblasts of this energy are apparently transforming\r\ninto [VAR FF00(0006)]black crystals[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(002A)]
The Tera Pokémon found at these black crystals\nare incredibly powerful...[VAR 0114(002A)]
So much so that average Trainers wouldn’t stand\na chance against them.[VAR 0114(002A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]You’re anything but average, but I’m afraid this is\ntoo dangerous—even for you,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(002A)]

Got it!
I dunno...
Hmmm... You almost seem a little TOO willing to\nagree.[VAR 0114(002A)]
I mean it! Don’t read into that like there’s some\nkind of hidden meaning![VAR 0114(002A)]
Sorry for getting you involved in this only to ask\nyou to step away, but...\c\nWhatever you do, do NOT go looking for these\nblack crystals![VAR 0114(002A)]

[VAR 0102(0001)], eh? Let’s see here...
Now THIS is a BIG Pokémon! Wow, you almost\nnever see one this huge!
[VAR BD06(0000)]This might just be the world’s biggest\n[VAR 0101(0001)]!
This is a serious big’un! Feels comforting to have\nsuch a bulky, reliable buddy around, doesn’t it?
This one seems a good sight bigger than average!\nIt’s quite a specimen—take good care of it!
This one seems a little bit bigger than average!
Look at that: a perfectly average-sized specimen!\nIt’s the gold standard for normality. Amazing!
This one seems a little bit smaller than average!
This one seems a good sight smaller than average!\nIt’s quite a specimen—take good care of it!
This is truly a little one! A pint-sized powerhouse\nof a [VAR 0101(0001)]. What a charmer!
Now THIS is a tiny Pokémon! Wow, you almost\nnever see one this little!
[VAR BD06(0000)]This might just be the world’s smallest\n[VAR 0101(0001)]!
I think this jumbo Pokémon deserves a mark for\nbeing such a monument to massiveness!
I think this mini Pokémon deserves a mark for\nbeing such a triumph of tininess!
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0102(0001)] received a\nJumbo Mark!
[VAR 0102(0001)] received a Mini Mark!
Come ask me anytime you want to know about\nyour Pokémon’s size!
Hey! Did you know Pokémon of the same species\ncan come in all sorts of sizes?\c\nTake my Pachirisu. It’s easy to see the difference\nbetween ’em, right?\c\nMe, I’ve got a sharp eye. I can tell the exact size\nof a Pokémon just by looking at it!

You got [VAR FF00(0008)]a variety of ingredients[VAR FF00(0000)]!
You put the ingredients in your Bag’s [VAR FF00(0008)]Picnic Items[VAR FF00(0000)]\npocket.
I just went shopping for sandwich ingredients and\nbought more than I could use. Mind taking some?
There you go. Try making some nice, tasty\nsandwiches! A picnic’s not a picnic without ’em!
Since you’re here, want to kick back with your\nPokémon at my picnic for a bit?
Hey, welcome to my picnic. Want to kick back\nwith your Pokémon for a bit?
Looks like you and your Pokémon got a good\nrest! Come on by and kick back anytime.
All right. But if you get worn out, don’t push it.\nJust come on by and kick back anytime.
My poor Bag’s full to bursting with ingredients!\nHere, lemme share some with you.
Sandwiches are best when you eat ’em outside!\nTry making some with the stuff I gave you!
Hey, since we’re here, want to have a picnic so\nyou can rest up a little?
Want to rest up a bit at my picnic?
You and your Pokémon look like you’re all full\nof energy! Come again anytime.
Aw, no need to be shy about it! You can come by\nanytime.
This spot is just about halfway between\nMesagoza and Artazon!\c\nI’m gonna make me a nice sandwich, then I’ll be\nall refueled and ready for more adventuring!\c\nHere—have some ingredients so you can get\nrefueled too!
Totally unrelated, but I heard there’s a cliff face\nnear here that...moves. Wonder if it’s true...
You should take a breather here and get ready so\nyou don’t get too surprised by any moving walls!
Are you running a little low on energy? Take a\nminute to rest and refuel!
Both people AND Pokémon need to refuel\nsometimes. Come back if you’re low on energy!
If you say so! Just remember not to push yourself\ntoo hard!
Whew, these hills are rougher than I thought\nthey’d be. I’m beat.\c\nTimes like these call for a nice meal to refresh\nthe body and soul!\c\nHere, take some of my ingredients to refresh\nyourself with!
Tackling tough challenges is great and all, but not\non an empty tummy!
We all need company and compassion, especially\non the road! Want to stop and refresh yourself?
Hills got you down? Need a little pick-me-up?
It’s nice to have a refreshing meal! We gotta help\neach other out in tough times. Stop by anytime!
Amazing what young folks like you can do! Wish I\nstill had that pep in my step!
Nothing goes with a sandwich like a nice view!\nHaha!\c\nGlad to have run into you, kiddo. Here’s a gift—\nmake sure to savor the taste of adventure!
Eating a sandwich and getting pumped with Meal\nPowers makes journeying all the better! Haha!
Care to rest those traveling feet and stop for a\nwhile, since you’re here?
Everyone needs a break now and then! Care to\nrest those traveling feet and enjoy the scenery?
Working hard is key, but so is getting off your\nfeet now and then! Besides, you can’t enjoy the\r\nscenery when you’re always on the move! Haha!
Fair enough—nothing wrong with living fast!\nCome by if you ever need a little rest.
I bought some ingredients on the cheap at the\nPorto Marinada market!\c\nBut I got more than I could eat, so...voilà! Have\nsome for yourself!
If you have a picnic with your friends and all\nbring lots of ingredients, you can whip up some\r\npretty wild sandwiches! It’s fun!
For now, though, you ought to take a breather—\nit’s rough going around these parts!
Going north or south from here is rough. You\nought to take a breather before you move on!
There you go—seems like you got a nice rest!\nGood luck on your adventure!
Ah, maybe you’re just headed west to Porto\nMarinada? I’ll mind my own business!
I saw some strange Pokémon around Casseroya\nLake, and they gave me a flash of inspiration!\c\nI came up with some great recipes—please use\nthem to make yourself some tasty sandwiches!
You learned how to make [VAR FF00(0006)]Sushi Sandwiches[VAR FF00(0000)]!
Now, I know sushi’s normally a rice dish. No\nbread’s involved.\c\nBut I figured...why not put sushi in a sandwich?\nThen you’ve got bread AND rice—twice as tasty!
Seeing as how we’ve run into each other at this\nnice lake, want to join me for a little break?
Ahhh, a lakeside picnic! Nothing better! Care to\nrest up?
I wonder what makes lakes so relaxing... Well,\nwhatever it is, it looks like you had a nice rest!
Got it. Come by if you’re ever craving a taste of\nthe lakeside life!

Which Pokémon can I have a look at?
[VAR BD06(0000)]OK, lemme see just how close you and\n[VAR 0102(0001)]\r\nare.\r\nHmm...
Whoa, you’re the best friends ever! I can tell just\nbeing together gives you warm fuzzies!
Wow, you’re pretty great friends! You sure mean\na lot to each other.
You’re good friends, all right! You definitely\nenjoy each other’s company!
You’re getting along well...but I’m sure you could\nget way friendlier!
You’re starting to get friendly. I bet you’ll get\nalong better soon!
You two seem kinda neutral—like you don’t mind\neach other. I hope you get closer!
Are you two just starting to get to know each\nother? I’m sensing some awkwardness here...
Oh my gosh! What happened between you two?!\nThere’s not even a smidge of friendship here!
I’ve got something for you to commemorate such\na nice friendship!
[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0102(0001)] received a Best\nFriends Ribbon!
Come show me what good friends you are\nanytime!
Hi! Y’know, as you spend time with your\nPokémon, they’ll grow friendlier toward you!

Oh, hello! Sorry, I was really thinking hard about\nsomething just now!\c\nI research sandwich recipes, you see.\c\nMy dream is to one day discover amazing recipes\nworthy of being called Master level!\c\nI can teach you recipes too, if you like!
You learned how to make some new sandwiches!
You learned how to make some new Master\nlevel sandwiches!
Those recipes make mouth-wateringly good\nsandwiches! Give ’em a try sometime!
If I think up new recipes, I’ll be sure to teach\nthem to you!
Oh, it’s you again! I thought up some new\nrecipes!
Oh, it’s you again!\c\nI’m making some new recipes, but they require\nsome very rare ingredients.\c\nFive different ingredients, actually. They’re\ncalled, uh, Herba...something-or-other.\c\nI bet I’d come up with a recipe right away if I\ncould just see those herbs for myself.
There are five of the Herba something-or-others\nin all.\c\nI bet I’d come up with some recipes right away if\nI could just see those condiments for myself.
H-hey! Isn’t that one of those Herba something-\nor-others you have there?!\c\nOhhh! I can feel the inspiration! The recipes are\nmaking themselves in my head right now!
*huff* *puff*\c\nThose are some wild recipes I came up with\njust now!\c\nGive ’em a try sometime. They’ll make top-tier\nsandwiches for sure!
Thanks to you, I was able to come up with all of\nthe Master-level sandwich recipes!\c\nThank you so much for helping me achieve\nmy dream!
I’ll bet there are still delicious sandwich recipes\nout there just waiting to be discovered!\c\nIf you come up with new recipes yourself, be sure\nto tell other people about them!

Welcome to Artazon, a town where the flowers\nare as bright and colorful as the artwork!
Look at the conflict on this Sunflora’s face! What\ncould the artist have been feeling?
I told my girlfriend clear as day, “let’s meet at the\nweird sculpture!” What’s taking her so long?
My boyfriend said we’d meet at “the weird\nsculpture,” but that hardly narrows it down...
Come on in and see if you can reach the center\nof Artazon’s famous hedge maze!
When the spring winds start to blow, Sunkern\ncome riding in on ’em.
Hmm, yes. Highly conceptual, accentuated with\ncontrasting modalities. Not that an amateur\r\nwould pick up on all that.
I came to see this famous piece! I can’t say I\nreally get it, but I like it!
Aw, not another dead end! I’m so lost...
Whoa, you actually found your way here! Nice!\c\nAlmost no one ever makes it this far, so I decided\nto make it into my secret base!
If you get worn out, try stopping for a breather.\nYou might notice things you didn’t before.
I can’t believe Sunkern turn into Sunflora when\nthey evolve! Evolution’s wild!
Check out my Cyclizar! We’re going on all sorts\nof journeys together!
This must be a Brassius original! Though the style\nseems a little...off.
I love high places! I heard outside of town, there\nare big, tall watchtowers in some places!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Text File : t05.dat

I came across the desert with Cyclizar, and I’m\ntotally exhausted!\c\nHealing up my team at the Pokémon Center gives\nthis human a chance to rest up, too!
This is Porto Marinada. Our famed market is\nalways bustling!
Come on up, stop on by! All our goods are\nfresher than fresh! Anything catch your eye?
Marinada comes from marinating, you know?\c\nWhen you soak food like meat or fish in lemon\njuice or vinegar sauce... Mmm, it’s delish!
The food here is really yummy!\c\nEverything’s fresh and wriggly! Kinda like me!
There’s a battle court right here in the market.\c\nNobody’s allowed to get into fights here—if\nyou’ve gotta work something out, you do it\r\nthrough a friendly Pokémon battle!
People say that a long time ago, ’fore I was even\nborn, there were always fights breaking out here.\c\nBut not anymore! Now we get lots of tourists, and\neven kids can walk around and feel safe.
Look at you, li’l M[VAR 1100(00FF,0302)]r.iss Student! Here to try your\nhand at the auction?\c\nCareful you don’t drive the price up too high, or\nyou’ll be crying into your empty pockets!
When night falls upon the city, ghostly Pokémon\nappear up above...\c\nWhy do you think they come?
A salty breeze coming in over the sea is so nice!\c\nI wonder if Steel-type Pokémon hate it, though?\nAll that salt must do a number on them...
It’s so handy having a Pokémon you can ride!\nFeels like I oughta return the favor and let my\r\nPokémon ride on my back instead sometimes! Ha!
More junk mail! Ugh!\c\nMaybe I’ll just crumple it all up into a ball that I\ncan throw around with my Pokémon...
These big, long metal box things here are what\nwe call shipping containers.\c\nWe pack ’em full of goods and things to sell,\nthen ship ’em off across the sea.
To get to other regions, we go by boat! Our\npoor Pokémon couldn’t carry us that far.
I swam to those rocks out in the water, and I’m\npretty sure I spotted something on top of them.\c\nBut I don’t know how to get up there... I’m no\npro at climbing cliffs or anything...
Yesss! I love goofy face boards! It never gets old\ntaking silly photos with ’em!
Hey, so, like...I get Finizen’s deal. I’ve seen them\naround. But what about that macho-looking one?\r\nIs that...a different Pokémon or something?
Oh my gosh, I’ve gotta get a shot of those\nKilowattrel flying over the ocean for my feed!\c\nYou sometimes find ’em resting on the beach\njust outside town, too.
Have you been to eat at the Kofu Lounge in\nCascarrafa? They serve up all the freshest hauls\r\nthere—direct from Porto Marinada, of course!
Ol’ man Kofu from the Cascarrafa Gym drops by\nthe market from time to time.\c\nThat old coot gets so excited whenever he wins\nat the auction that he dances a merry little jig!
When I was younger, I got into my fair share of\nbidding wars and brawls both. I was a real spitfire!
It’s such a nice beach, yet almost no one knows\nabout it! People just flock to the market instead.

This is Medali! Kind of sounds like “medley,”\nright? A fitting name for a town with such a mix\r\nof people and things!
Have you been to the Treasure Eatery? I hear the\nGym Leader is a regular there!
We have the best food in all of Paldea! Come on\nin and give it a try!
Our dishes here at Seafood Fresco are fresh and\npacked full of minerals!
I think your Pokémon is saying it wants to come\neat here at my restaurant!
I hear fancy restaurants have something called\na “dress code”...\r\nI wonder what kind of code that is?
I want to feed my Pokémon something tasty!\nI need to save up my money.
Our spicy dishes are the best! Come on in!
We are currently open to customers with or\nwithout reservations.
There’s a big gate at the top of the path leading\nto the Great Crater of Paldea. You can’t get in.
I heard that there’s an off-limits facility called\nthe Zero Gate behind the gate up that path!
Medali’s most famous restaurant, the Treasure\nEatery, is right here!\c\nWe also have the secret dish for those of you\ncurrently taking on the Gym Test!
I heard that you can change your Pokémon’s Tera\nType at the Treasure Eatery, but the chef turned\r\nme away the moment I asked about it...
How about a sandwich? They’re tempting even\nwhen you’re full—that’s how good they are!
Before climbing Glaseado Mountain, I like to\nvisit the shopping area in Medali and fuel up\r\nwith something to eat.
This town is an important hub here in Paldea.\c\nLots of people from other places come through,\nso naturally, lots of restaurants have popped up.
My little Greedent here has gotten bigger\nrecently. I wonder if it’s about time to move to a\r\nbigger living space...
The way up Glaseado Mountain is rough! Be sure\nyou’re prepared if you’re headed out that way.
This town doesn’t have a battle court, y’know?\nI wonder where you battle the Gym Leader...
Long ago, the space at the bottom of these stairs\nwas a stage for plays and concerts.
Hello there, young’un. Are you a student? The\nTreasure Hunt’s rolled around again, then, eh?

Welcome to Zapapico! It’s a mining town, full of\nhardworking folks.
Sure, big cities are fun to go visit, but plain little\ntowns like this one have their own charm!
The name Zapapico comes from a word for a\npickaxe. Fitting for a town of mostly miners, no?
Nothing like finding a bench when you really\nneed one! You’ll understand when you’re older.
I saw this Pokémon in the mine that was so big,\nit was like a mountain!
Well, I saw a Pokémon so long it was like a river!
Phanpy’s a Ground type! It’s resistant to poison,\nand it shrugs off electricity altogether!\c\nJust, um, don’t pour water on it.
My buddies and I battle our Pokémon on that\ncourt on our way home from work.
My job would be a lot harder without my dear\nCarkol around!\c\nBy that, I mean it provides moral support, not\njust manual labor...although it helps with that too.
Once, I was on the verge of fainting a little ways\noutside town, when a wild Pokémon Center lady\r\nappeared and came to my rescue!
Flying Taxi here! Take a ride through the sky,\npowered by Squawkabilly!\c\nNeed a lift? Just open your map app and give us\na call. We’ll pick you up practically anywhere!

Montenevera is a town with lotsa snow and lost\nsouls. But lately, the concerts are a real draw too!
The fluttering snow! The flickering candlelight!\nEvery day is like a festival here! Don’t you think?
The Snow Slope Run is popular these days. You\ncan try it out on Glaseado Mountain!
Isn’t Snorunt cute? Only the females have a\nchance of evolving into Froslass.
It’s cold again today. I’ll have something spicy to\neat to warm me up!
Do you know about the ultimate class of\nsandwiches? They’re called “Master” sandwiches,\r\nand no one seems to know the recipes for them.
Everything tastes better when you eat outside!
The Gym Leader here used to be Tyme, but she\nretired a year and a half ago. Her sister Ryme is\r\nthe Gym Leader now.
Have you ever seen one of Ryme’s concerts? Her\nmusic shakes you right down to your soul!
The stage lights up purple for the Gym Test! It’s\nso pretty!

Welcome to Alfornada, a town where you can\nsee the stars and find excellent pottery.
My family’s been making pottery for generations!\nIsn’t that cool?
The water’s trickling out...\c\nI wish it’d shoot out like Hydro Pump, though.\nWouldn’t that be neat?
This plate’s huuuge! How big of a sandwich d’you\nthink would fit on it?
Tableware made in Alfornada is popular all\nacross Paldea!
Pottery is born from the kiln!\c\nPotters put shaped clay inside and let it fire nice\nand slow for days.
The battle court here was originally built as an\nobservatory to view the stars.
There was a Pokémon that reminded me of tea\nup the hilly road ahead here.
Wasn’t it rough coming all the way out to\nAlfornada?\c\nBut now that you’ve been here once, you can use\nthe Flying Taxi to come back whenever you want.
Alfornada is in such an inconvenient location!\nHaving a trusty Cyclizar is an absolute must here.
I actually came to see the Gym Leader, Tulip. But\nthese plates are super cute too!
The Pokémon mosaic art on the observatory is\nreally cute, isn’t it?\c\nIt reminds me of some kind of old video game!

I guess so
Thank you.[VAR 0114(0009)]
With this, you’re officially a member of\nOperation Starfall![VAR 0114(0009)]

Does this “Operation Starfall” of yours have\nroom for one more member?[VAR 0114(002C)]
Wha—? Who are you?![VAR 0114(0009)]
The name’s Clive.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Oh? And how long have you been spying on us?[VAR 0114(0009)]

I guess...maybe?
We’re not pals!
Ahaha! Shy as ever, I see![VAR 0114(001E)]
We’re talking about going up against Team Star\nhere. It’s not something you can join in for fun.[VAR 0114(0009)]
I’m well aware. I just need to sort out some...\nunsettled business with Team Star, that’s all.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Besides, I tend to get the job done well. Not\nthat you can take my word for it, but it’s true.[VAR 0114(001E)]
... ... ...\c\nI suppose I’m hardly in a position to refuse help.\nWelcome to the operation, Clive.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Great. That settles it, then.[VAR 0114(001E)]
I think I heard your name earlier... Cassiopeia,\nwas it? Who exactly are you?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Team Star and I...share some history. That’s all I’ll\nsay for now.[VAR 0114(0009)]
I see. In that case, I won’t press you further.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Good. Now, back to business—let’s talk\nOperation Starfall.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Yes. What would you have us do?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Simply put, I want you to raid each one of\nTeam Star’s bases.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Then you’ll defeat the bosses of the team...and\nput an end to their rule![VAR 0114(0009)]
“Put an end to their rule”...? You mean we need\nto oust these bosses from their roles somehow?[VAR 0114(001E)]
That’s right. Team Star is made up of five squads,\nand each of those squads has its own base.[VAR 0114(0009)]
You should be able to see the front gates of one\nof those bases now, in fact.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Ah, yes...I can see them over there.[VAR 0114(001E)]
On the other side of those is the base proper.[VAR 0114(0009)]
And somewhere within that base lies one of your\ntargets: a squad boss.[VAR 0114(0009)]
OK. I’m starting to get the idea.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Well, that’s just the outline. The key to the whole\noperation is the code that the team has to follow.[VAR 0114(0009)]
If someone challenges one of the squad bosses\nto a battle, they have no choice but to accept.[VAR 0114(0009)]
And what’s more, if they just so happen to lose\nthat battle...\c\nthey must forfeit their role as boss altogether![VAR 0114(0009)]
I went ahead and issued challenges to each base\nunder your name, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nThey’re basically declarations of war.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Now all of Team Star knows that we’re looking\nfor a fight.[VAR 0114(0009)]
So let’s say we defeat all the bosses and they\nstep down from their roles... What happens next?[VAR 0114(001E)]

The rest of the team crumbles with no one left to\nlead them. That’s what happens.[VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 45]
It’s a solid plan, but not without wrinkles.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Each base has a bunch of Pokémon inside to\nfend off intruders, and the bases themselves are\r\na considerable size.[VAR 0114(0009)]
Your garden-variety Trainer would be overrun\nlong before they’d get anywhere near the boss.[VAR 0114(0009)]
That’s why your skills are essential to this\noperation, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0009)]
[~ 50]
[~ 51]
Defeat the Pokémon inside the base, and drag\nthe boss out from where they’re hiding.[VAR 0114(0009)]
First things first, though—you’ll need to deal with\nany grunts that might be guarding the front gates.[VAR 0114(0009)]
And what will you be doing in the meantime?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Like I said before, I have a history with Team Star.[VAR 0114(0009)]
That means I can’t operate out in the open.\nI’ll back you up from afar.[VAR 0114(0009)]
All right. And what will my role be?[VAR 0114(001E)]

I need answers, that’s all.\c\nHow do I resolve this situation with Team Star...\nand what’s causing its members’ odd behavior?[VAR 0114(001E)]
What situation?
Odd behavior?
Team Star is the subject of more than a few nasty\nrumors swirling around the academy, you know.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Some say their bullying has caused a worrying\nnumber of students to drop out of school...\c\nOthers say they’re holed up in their bases,\nplotting to cause trouble for the academy.[VAR 0114(001E)]
But these are rumors. The matter I am directly\nconfronted with is something else...[VAR 0114(001E)]
I’m talking about Team Star’s persistent truancy.\nThey’ve all been skipping class for a while now...[VAR 0114(001E)]
Five of them in particular—the so-called “bosses”\nof Team Star—haven’t so much as set foot inside\r\na classroom for over a year.[VAR 0114(001E)]
And it seems the team’s rank and file have\nrecently started stirring up mischief as well.[VAR 0114(001E)]
That’s why I took it upon myself to issue a direct\norder to Team Star to disband.[VAR 0114(001E)]
I informed them that should they refuse, I would\nhave no choice but to expel all students affiliated\r\nwith their team...[VAR 0114(001E)]
But I’m afraid there’s been no response. And the\ndeadline I set for them to make their choice\r\nbetween dissolution or expulsion is nigh upon us.[VAR 0114(001E)]

What a massive idiot, creating Team Star and just\nhoping their plan would miraculously work out.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I don’t know about that
You really think so?

In truth, the boy you knew as Clive was none\nother than the director of Uva Academy...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Mr. Clavell![VAR 0114(000A)]
N-no way!
I already knew that
Yes, this must be quite the shock! My disguise\nwas perfect, after all.[VAR 0114(000A)]
What?! But my disguise was perfect!\c\nAlthough, now that I think about it...I did neglect\nto keep up my youthful act on a few occasions.\r\nThat must have been what gave me away.[VAR 0114(000A)]

For real?!
That’s impossible
Honest to goodness![VAR 0114(000A)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]So, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]! Now\nyou\r\nknow\r\nI’m\r\nthe\r\nbig\r\nboss!\r\nThat\r\nmeans\r\nthere\r\nis\r\njust\r\none\r\nthing\r\nleft\r\nto do![VAR 0114(000A)]

It seems you have grown quite splendidly over\nthe course of your Treasure Hunt.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And here, once again, I must apologize—[VAR 0114(000A)]
I am not actually Cassiopeia.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Though Clive and myself being the same person\nwas no lie, mind you...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Cassiopeia’s true identity remains hidden.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But I believe I can hazard a guess as to who\nthey may be.[VAR 0114(000A)]
That is why I sought to spare you from having to\nconfront them in battle.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Their sorrows...should not be yours to bear.[VAR 0114(000A)]
However, Cassiopeia has settled on a course of\naction and is determined to see it through.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I do not imagine any ordinary student could hope\nto stand against them and win.[VAR 0114(000A)]
So, I challenged you to a battle to test your skill.[VAR 0114(000A)]
If you had lost, it would have fallen to me to\nbring down Cassiopeia. Such was my resolve.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But it turns out you are as strong as you are kind.\nIf anyone has a chance at saving that poor child,\r\nit is surely you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
As an educator it shames me to burden one of\nmy students with such a task...[VAR 0114(000A)]
But please...defeat Cassiopeia! Take on the big\nboss of Team Star and win![VAR 0114(000A)]
Yes, sir!
Leave it to me!
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. I leave\nthis in your hands.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You there! What do you think you’re doing?![VAR 0114(0025)]
Ah! Ms. Tyme, a pleasure to see you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
It’s no pleasure at all, Mr. Clavell![VAR 0114(0025)]
I come here to investigate reports of an illicit\nbattle on school grounds, and what do I find?[VAR 0114(0025)]
Why, the director of the academy himself!\nFacing off against one of our students, no less!\r\nWhat were you thinking?![VAR 0114(0025)]
Ah, no, if I could just explain. You see, it is a\nrather sad tale...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Oh, spare me! Your excuses reek worse than a\nStunky’s behind![VAR 0114(0025)]
A Stunky’s b-b-behind?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Ahem![VAR 0114(000A)]
Remember—the big boss asked us to meet them\nin the schoolyard after dark.[VAR 0114(000A)]

When I saw you make quick work of those Team\nStar lackeys outside school that time, the idea\r\nfor Operation Starfall suddenly came to me.[VAR 0114(0009)]
My skills let me get hold of as much LP as I want,\nso I decided to use that to tempt you into\r\nhelping me out.[VAR 0114(0009)]

Yeah, well, that’s what happens when you round\nup a buncha bullies in the courtyard and make a\r\nshow of learning ’em some manners.[VAR 0114(001F)]
But we didn’t even fight them in the end.\nWe didn’t do anything wrong![VAR 0114(0022)]
Indeed. Merely did we declare our intention to\nbattle tooth and nail should the villains persist\r\nin their tyrannous oppression.\c\n’Twas a bloodless victory, we assure you![VAR 0114(0023)]
Yeah! They didn’t even send out their Pokémon—\nthey just blubbered and apologized a whole lot...\r\nOur outfits must’ve spooked them good![VAR 0114(0020)]
But the bullies made a huge stink about what\nwent down, and then they all ended up leaving\r\nthe academy.\c\nOur plan backfired epically. There’s no way we’re\ngetting off scot-free.[VAR 0114(0009)]

I’m glad I could see this through to the end.[VAR 0114(001E)]
I guess this is it for Team Star...and me, too—[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hold that thought, Mis— Ah...Penny! I’d like to\ncheck something with you first.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Check...what?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Why resort to something like Operation Starfall\nif you’re the big boss of Team Star?\c\nWasn’t there any other way to handle this?[VAR 0114(001E)]
I tried telling the bosses that we were done once\nbefore. But they still didn’t quit...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Why not simply order them to?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Our code states that no one in the team has the\nright to order people around. I could ask them\r\nall to do stuff, but I could never order them.[VAR 0114(0008)]
So, it’s back to the code once again... The bosses\nmust’ve taken it very seriously.[VAR 0114(001E)]
They did. That’s why I knew I could use it to force\nTeam Star to disband.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Because the bosses would do anything the code\nrequired of them? Even leave the team?[VAR 0114(001E)]
Yes... And according to the code, they had to\naccept any challenge made to them.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Thus the idea for Operation Starfall...[VAR 0114(001E)]
Cassiopeia. Let me ask you one last thing.[VAR 0114(001E)]
What does Team Star— No, what do your friends\nin the team mean to you?[VAR 0114(001E)]
... ... ...\nThey’re...[VAR 0114(0008)]
They’re my greatest treasure.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Splendid. Thank you for apprising me of the\nsituation, Miss Penny.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Wha—?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Now, young lady, there’s something I should very\nmuch like to discuss with you.[VAR 0114(001E)]
Hey, quit it with the old geezer act, Clive!\nYou’re creeping me out...[VAR 0114(0008)]
...Indeed. Well then, before we talk further, allow\nme to reveal to you my own secret identity![VAR 0114(001E)]
Ha-hah![VAR 0114(001E)]
D-Director Clavell?![VAR 0114(0008)]
Just as Cassiopeia was your disguise, the boy\nyou knew as Clive was mine![VAR 0114(000A)]
But... But why?![VAR 0114(0008)]
[~ 27]
I needed a way to talk to Team Star on\nequal terms.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Students do tend to shy from speaking their mind\nto their teachers, after all... Much more so when\r\nfaced with the director of the academy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Yeah, but...where do I even start? Wasn’t the\noutfit a bit much?\c\nPlus I have some big feelings about that wig...[VAR 0114(0008)]

On behalf of the academy, I have something I\nwould like to say to Team Star.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You all have...my sincerest apologies.[VAR 0114(000A)]
...Come again?[VAR 0114(0008)]
As director of the academy, I let you down. My\nhandling of your situation was a dismal failure...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Wha—? I still don’t... I mean... Why?[VAR 0114(0008)]
You all told me about your reasons for forming\nTeam Star and about your subsequent actions.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Ever since my first days as director, all I’ve ever\nexperienced of the academy is an environment\r\nblessedly free from bullying.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But I now know this peace was built on the backs\nof your hurt and anger—and, of course, your\r\nimmense courage in putting things to right.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And so, I’ll get straight to the conclusion.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The academy’s order for Team Star to disband\nand my threat to expel those who did not obey...\r\nare hereby revoked![VAR 0114(000A)]
Does that mean what I think it means...?[VAR 0114(0021)]
Indeed! Team Star can continue to exist, should\nthat be your wish![VAR 0114(000A)]
Woo-hoo! Penny, isn’t this great? Now we can all\nstay together![VAR 0114(0022)]
O, mine heart is giddy with glee![VAR 0114(0023)]
B-but...I betrayed all of you...[VAR 0114(0008)]
You mean Operation Starfall? Director Clavell\ntold us all about it![VAR 0114(0020)]
Far as we heard, you only went through with it\nto save us from getting expelled!\c\nYou were just worried about us, right?[VAR 0114(0021)]
Not like we’d ever chuck the team just ’cause\nsomeone told us to, after all. Ain’t our style.[VAR 0114(001F)]
I cannot even begin to imagine how you must\nhave fear’d for us, Lady Penny...[VAR 0114(0023)]
Sorry for making you worry, B.B. We’re all\nOK now.[VAR 0114(0022)]
But—! Even so...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hold on, everyone. I’ve more to say.[VAR 0114(000A)]
As previously stated, the requirement for Team\nStar to disband has been revoked.[VAR 0114(000A)]
However! There are still some unsettled matters\nto discuss. Allow me to provide a few examples...[VAR 0114(000A)]
Your protracted truancy! Your brazen\ncustomization of school uniforms![VAR 0114(000A)]
Your unauthorized usage of academy equipment![VAR 0114(000A)]
Your reckless modification and jeopardous\ndriving of Pokémon-powered vehicles![VAR 0114(000A)]
Need I go on? Your flagrant disregard for school\nrules cannot simply be overlooked![VAR 0114(000A)]
Thus, as punishment, you will all be required to\nengage in community service.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Community...service?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Yes. Specifically, I will be asking you to manage\nthe STCs.[VAR 0114(000A)]
Aaand that stands for...?[VAR 0114(0008)]
The Star Training Centers![VAR 0114(000A)]
They shall be facilities for cultivating Pokémon\nTrainers’ talents. I plan for the academy to found\r\nthem in collaboration with the Pokémon League.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]The idea came to me when I saw M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nbattling\r\nh[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser\r\nway\r\nthrough\r\nyour bases.[VAR 0114(000A)]
The bases’ construction, as well as the battle\ntactics employed by the students in Team Star,\r\nare remarkably unique and creative![VAR 0114(000A)]
I would ask that you continue your team activities\nbut henceforth as STC staff members, using your\r\nformer bases as training facilities.[VAR 0114(000A)]
And that is the sum of it. Does anyone have\nany concerns?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Um...no? It sounds like fun, so I don’t see how\nthis’d be anything but a win-win...[VAR 0114(0008)]
This may be a weird thing to say since the STCs\nare supposed to be a punishment and all, but\r\nyou should totally join in too, Penny![VAR 0114(0020)]
’Tis true... We would most happily have you at\nour sides, my lady.[VAR 0114(0023)]
We can go to school together too! That way if\nanything happens, we’ll be there to protect you![VAR 0114(0022)]
We were already talkin’ about how great it’d be\nto have both Team Star and school in our lives.\r\nThis’d be a sweet deal for us![VAR 0114(0021)]
So, whaddya say...?[VAR 0114(001F)]
You guys...[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR 0100(0000)]...what do you think?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I think it sounds great!
Give it your best!
Huh? B-but—! Ummm... I just...[VAR 0114(0008)]
No need to give your response right this moment,\nMiss Penny. Do take some time to decide.[VAR 0114(000A)]
For now, at least, I think our little group should\ngo their separate ways.\c\nAh. Not to say you should break up Team Star\nafter all! I simply meant it is time to leave.[VAR 0114(000A)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]. Please stop\nby\r\nmy\r\noffice\r\nlater,\r\nif\r\nyou would.[VAR 0114(000A)]

[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, here you are, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
I wanted to thank you for all your hard work in\nresolving the situation with Team Star.[VAR 0114(000A)]
If not for you, I suspect I would have done the\nteam a grievous injustice in my choice of\r\npunishment for their actions.[VAR 0114(000A)]
You have my sincere gratitude.[VAR 0114(000A)]
*knock knock knock*
Who is it?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Um... It’s Penny.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Ah, Miss Penny! Do come in.[VAR 0114(000A)]
H-hello, Director.[VAR 0114(0008)]
About the STCs... I’d like to work on them\ntogether with the rest of Team Star.[VAR 0114(0008)]
That’s wonderful news. Thank you very much\nfor your favorable response.[VAR 0114(000A)]
But, um...I...I should be punished more heavily\nthan the others, I think...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Why so? Because of Operation Starfall?[VAR 0114(000A)]
No, not that. Because of the other really bad\nthing I did...[VAR 0114(0008)]
And what would that be?[VAR 0114(000A)]
Um... Y’know the LP I gave you both in exchange\nfor helping me with Operation Starfall...?[VAR 0114(0008)]
I got hold of it sort of...illegally...by hacking the\nPokémon League’s LP management system.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Ah. I see. That is...quite the revelation.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I did not think such a thing was even possible\nin the first place.[VAR 0114(000A)]
It wasn’t all that har— Errr, I mean...I’m really\nsorry and I won’t do it again.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Hmm. This matter is rather out of my jurisdiction,\nI’m afraid.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I will have to consult Ms. Geeta, the Pokémon\nLeague chairwoman, on how best to proceed.[VAR 0114(000A)]
I figured as much...[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]I do apologize, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\nbut\r\nI\r\nwill\r\nhave\r\nto\r\nask\r\nyou\r\nto\r\ngive\r\nus\r\nsome privacy.[VAR 0114(000A)]

The six of us thought up that catchphrase back\nwhen we created the team.[VAR 0114(0008)]
It’s so cringey it’s perfect, you know?[VAR 0114(0008)]
Anyway...about the LP thing. I thought I was\ngoing down big-time for hacking the League\r\nPoint system, but they’re letting me off easy...[VAR 0114(0008)]
That’s great!
What happened?
The Pokémon League said they’ll waive my debt\nif I do some volunteer engineering for them.\c\nThey even asked me to come work for them after\nI graduate, if you can believe that.[VAR 0114(0008)]
Director Clavell and that Geeta lady kept\ncomplimenting me, like, a weird amount.\c\nApparently, I have “outstanding talent” or\nsomething...[VAR 0114(0008)]
... ... ...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Sorry for calling you out here to meet like this.\nI’m still not so great with people face-to-face...[VAR 0114(0008)]
I never seem to find the right words, but, um...[VAR 0114(0008)]
Th-thank you...so much.[VAR 0114(0008)]
You saved Team Star—and my friends along\nwith it.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I know words won’t ever be enough to properly\nthank you for all you’ve done, so here...[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’m sure you’ll put this to good use.[VAR 0114(0008)]
And one more thing...[VAR 0114(0008)]
I want to repay the debt I owe you. If you ever\nthink of a way I can do that, just let me know.[VAR 0114(0008)]
I’m great with machines and hacking and stuff...[VAR 0114(0008)]
[VAR BD06(0000)]So next time, I’ll be the one helping you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
Be seeing you, then. Hasta la vistar! ☆[VAR 0114(0008)]
