The Legendary Treasure
Countless days into our descent,\nwe reached at last the very depths of\nthe Great Crater. There we found a\ncave with formations of gemstone,\nshining blindingly bright as far as we\ncould see. Perhaps that strange light\nitself is the guardian said to watch\nover treasure deep within the crater.
Monsters of Area Zero
As we descended further into Area\nZero, we began to catch glimpses\nof mysterious Pokémon—though we\nwondered if these huge, ferocious\nbeasts were indeed Pokémon at all.\nOne of our team suffered a brutal\nblow from such a beast and was\nmortally wounded, forcing us to\nretreat for a time.
Monsters of Area Zero
A member of the survey team\ncaptured this photograph by chance.\nI notice a passing resemblance to\nthe Pokémon known as Donphan,\nyet differences such as its sheer\nsize and the shape of its back set\nit apart—as do its great tusks.
Monsters of Area Zero
As we descended further into Area\nZero, we began to catch glimpses\nof mysterious Pokémon—though we\nwondered if these compact, cruel\nbeasts were indeed Pokémon at all.\nOne of our team suffered a brutal\nblow from such a beast and was\nmortally wounded, forcing us to\nretreat for a time.
Monsters of Area Zero
A member of the survey team\ncaptured this photograph by chance.\nI notice a passing resemblance to\nthe Pokémon known as Donphan,\nyet differences such as its texture\nand the way it moves suggest it is\nbiologically separate—to say nothing\nof its treads of iron.
The Great Crater of Paldea
A photograph from the survey team’s\npoint of ingress to the crater, which\nis visible in the background. Luck\nfavored us with fine weather, making\nfor a smooth outset. But clouds\nobscured the crater’s distant depths,\nwhere the treasure of legend is said\nto lie. Now, onward and downward.
Area Zero: Cartograph
Ledges form a spiral down the inner\nwalls of Area Zero, offering a path\nof descent. Vegetation and sources\nof water are here as well. Legends\ntell that precious stones or wondrous\nfruits have long slept in Area Zero’s\ndepths, protected by some manner\nof guardian.
About the Author
Heath, author of the Scarlet Book,\nshown here with his partner Cyclizar.\nA natural historian as well as a writer,\nhe was chosen for the Area Zero\nExpedition and penned this account\nupon returning from the Great Crater\nof Paldea. Cyclizar aided the\nexpedition as well by bearing the\nteam’s luggage and equipment.

Cyclizar aided the\nexpedition as well by bearing the\nteam’s luggage and equipment.
The Adventure into Area Zero
Within the Great Crater of Paldea\nlies the mysterious Area Zero—a\nplace home to such landscapes, such\nplant life, and such Pokémon as we\nhad never seen. It is inhospitable to\nhuman life, and as such, I suspect\nsomething altogether unknown to\nhumankind sleeps in its depths.
The Adventure into Area Zero
A photograph of a spot where the\nsurvey team rested on day two of\nthe expedition. Note the strange\nsymbols inscribed in the ground\nhere—were they left by explorers in\nthe time of the Paldean Empire, or\ncould they be older still? Regardless,\nthey seemed as if they must hold\nsome meaning.
Pokémon of Area Zero
Sketches by a survey team member.\n\nSurprisingly, the Pokémon species we\nobserved in the upper strata of Area\nZero seemed little different from\nthose seen outside the crater.\n\nNow and then, we heard unfamiliar\ncries from the lower strata.
Our Generous Sponsor
The author, Heath, pictured with the\ndirector of Naranja Academy. The\nacademy’s generous funding made\nthe Area Zero Expedition possible,\nand the data gathered has been\nshared with the academy in hopes\nthat it will aid in the institution’s\nresearch work and foster future\ngenerations of scholars and scientists.

Mysterious Plates
During our descent into Area Zero,\nwe came across a buried metal plate\ninscribed with a strange symbol. We\nattempted to shave off a piece of\nthe plate but failed to leave even a\nscratch. Even determining the nature\nof the metal seems beyond modern\nscience. We know not why the\ninscription was made, let alone how.
Herba Mystica
Area Zero was home to wondrous\nherbs that instantly impart vigor\nwhen eaten. We dubbed them Herba\nMystica and attempted to grow some\nin areas around Paldea. However,\nbefore we could harvest, the\nherbs were eaten by Pokémon—\nwhich in turn grew large and strong.\nWe call these Titan Pokémon.

A Phantom Memory
During our exploration of Area\nZero’s depths, I—Heath—strayed\nfrom the team and was later found\nunconscious. When awoken, I could\nonly recall speaking with someone in\nan unfamiliar place, as if in a dream.\nI was found holding the page shown\nhere. The handwriting is my own, but\nI have no memory of writing this.

Pressing the [VAR FF00(0006)]R Button[VAR FF00(0000)] is a quick and easy way to tell\nyour [VAR FF00(0006)]lead Pokémon[VAR FF00(0000)], “All right, buddy—[VAR FF00(0006)]Let’s Go![VAR FF00(0000)]”\nOnce you give the go-ahead, your Pokémon will\nset out on its own to [VAR FF00(0006)]battle [VAR FF00(0000)]nearby Pokémon\nor [VAR FF00(0006)]pick up items[VAR FF00(0000)] it finds in the area.
When your Pokémon is low on energy—which happens\nwhen its HP is low—it won’t be able to go exploring\non its own. So if your Pokémon gets [VAR FF00(0006)]weak[VAR FF00(0000)], try to\n[VAR FF00(0006)]heal[VAR FF00(0000)] it up with a Potion or some other item!
When your Pokémon starts a battle while exploring\non its own, you won’t need to give any orders.\nIt can battle on its own with [VAR FF00(0006)]Auto Battles[VAR FF00(0000)], meaning\nthat you can keep searching the area for new\ndiscoveries while watching over it from nearby.
Auto Battles will be decided by the [VAR FF00(0006)]strength [VAR FF00(0000)]and\nthe [VAR FF00(0006)]types [VAR FF00(0000)]of the Pokémon taking part in the battle,\nso keep that in mind when you’re choosing which\nof your Pokémon to send out on its own!

Using the Union Circle, you can [VAR FF00(0006)]play together[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]with friends[VAR FF00(0000)] as you adventure around Paldea!
If you want to play with [VAR FF00(0006)]nearby friends[VAR FF00(0000)], you should\nleave your internet connection in [VAR FF00(0006)]Offline Mode[VAR FF00(0000)].\nIf you want to play with [VAR FF00(0006)]faraway friends[VAR FF00(0000)], change\nto [VAR FF00(0006)]Online Mode[VAR FF00(0000)]. You can connect to or disconnect\nfrom the internet from within the [VAR FF00(0006)]Poké Portal[VAR FF00(0000)].
When you want to invite friends to play\ntogether with you, form a group and then\n[VAR FF00(0006)]tell your friends the Link Code you set[VAR FF00(0000)].\nWhen you want to join a friend’s group, you’ll\nneed to [VAR FF00(0006)]enter the Link Code they share with you[VAR FF00(0000)].

Terastallizing
Terastallizing
[~ 93]
Here in the Paldea region, Pokémon can crystallize\nthrough a strange phenomenon. The people call this\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Terastallizing[VAR FF00(0000)]. You can Terastallize your Pokémon by\nselecting the [VAR FF00(0006)]TERASTALLIZE! [VAR FF00(0000)]button in battle.
When a Pokémon Terastallizes, its type changes to\nits [VAR FF00(0006)]Tera Type[VAR FF00(0000)]. Moves of the same type as this Tera\nType will become much more powerful than usual.
After Terastallizing a Pokémon once, you [VAR FF00(0006)]won’t be[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]able to Terastallize a Pokémon again until you heal[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]up at a Pokémon Center[VAR FF00(0000)], so use this strategy wisely\nto seize victory in battles!

You can enjoy picnics together with the Pokémon\nin your party. If you’re playing in a group with\nfriends through the Union Circle, you can also\nhave [VAR FF00(0006)]picnics with friends[VAR FF00(0000)].
You won’t be able to set up a picnic table in the\nmiddle of a town or where there isn’t enough space\nto get everything out—or on inclines, where things\nmight go sliding off your table! Look for [VAR FF00(0006)]wide-open,[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]level spots outside of towns[VAR FF00(0000)] when you want to picnic!

Try whipping up a delicious sandwich by piling your\nfavorite ingredients up on sliced bread.\nIf you’re picnicking with friends, you can take part in\nsandwich prep together as well!
The [VAR FF00(0006)]sandwich ingredients[VAR FF00(0000)] and [VAR FF00(0006)]sandwich picks\n[VAR FF00(0000)]you need to put together a great sandwich can\nbe [VAR FF00(0006)]bought [VAR FF00(0000)]at various shops found in towns and\ncities. Stock up on your favorite ingredients\nand picks, and see what you can create.
In [VAR FF00(0006)]Recipe Mode[VAR FF00(0000)], ingredients are selected for you. All\nyou have to do is skillfully arrange them on the bread\nto make the sandwich in the recipe. But if you drop\nan ingredient and don’t get everything the recipe calls\nfor, you may end up making something different.

Seems you know a thing or two about battle.
[~ 9]
[~ 10]
How come I’M the one seeing stars?!
[~ 12]
[~ 13]
Your Pokémon burned so bright...
[~ 15]
[~ 16]
Looks like you’re headed right past my\nSmoliv wall!
[~ 18]
[~ 19]
Your mighty will blew right past me after all!
[~ 21]
[~ 22]
[~ 23]
[~ 24]
[~ 25]
Shucks. I let ol’ man Kofu down...
[~ 27]
Anyone here taking\nthe Gym Test?! ▶
You’re taking the Gym Test, aren’t you? I can tell!\nGet ready to spill the beans about your clue!
Do...do I have to tell you my clue since I lost?
Fine, here’s my clue: Listen really closely to\n[VAR FF00(0006)]the blue bird Pokémon[VAR FF00(0000)]!\c\nI’m still puzzling over that word it said. All that\nthinking kept me from focusing on the battle...
I’ve got to order\nthat secret dish... ▶
Do you have a clue about the secret dish? Guess\nI’d better beat you and learn it!
I can’t believe this Gym Test makes us steal each\nother’s clues... That’s fighting dirty!
The clue I was given is to look for...[VAR FF00(0006)]a dark spot[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]surrounded by stairs[VAR FF00(0000)]!\c\nI don’t remember seeing any particularly dark\nspots in this town...
I’m gonna beat\nthe Medali Gym! ▶
’Scuse me! You’re taking the Gym Test, right?\nTell me your clue about the secret dish!\r\nC’mon! Tell me, tell me, tell meee!
I wish we could just trade clues like we trade\nPokémon...
My clue is to look for something that’s [VAR FF00(0006)]the odd[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]one out at one of the ice cream stands[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nCome to think of it, I could use some ice cream\nas a pick-me-up since I lost!
[~ 40]
Win or lose, Iono Hype Squad forever!

Well...you know what I haven’t lost to you in?\nMy devotion to Miss Iono!

[~ 64]
Vaultin’ Veluza! Yer a lively one, aren’t ya! A little\nTOO lively, if I do say so myself!
[~ 66]
[~ 67]
You certainly threw me for a loop.
[~ 69]
[~ 70]
You melted straight through my ice...
[~ 72]
[~ 73]
You’re as flashy and bright as a 10,000,000-volt\nThunderbolt, friendo!
[~ 75]
[~ 76]
Your strength has a magic to it that cannot be\nwashed away.
[~ 78]
[~ 79]
Givin’ up the ghost’s not really my style. I’ll let\nyou have this one, though, baby.
[~ 81]
[~ 82]
Not bad, kiddo.
[~ 84]
[~ 85]
Uagh?! Mmmuuuggghhh...
[~ 87]
[~ 88]
Well, that took the wind from under our wings...
[~ 90]

Why did such a sassy kid have to be so strong...
[~ 195]
[~ 196]
I talk big, but I’m no warrior...
[~ 198]
[~ 199]
Well, well.
[~ 201]
[~ 202]
I lost...but my defeat’s not the one that matters.
[~ 204]
[~ 205]
I defended myself all right... But it wasn’t enough!
[~ 207]

[~ 228]
[~ 229]
A shocking glow up, to be sure.
[~ 231]
[~ 232]
You’re cool, my friend—you move my SOUL!
[~ 234]
[~ 235]
Your burning passion... I kinda like it, to be\nhonest.
[~ 237]
[~ 238]
Ahhh...vant-garde!
[~ 240]
[~ 241]
What a refreshin’ loss! My mind’s as clear as\nstill water!
[~ 243]
[~ 244]
I see you’ve emerged from your chrysalis and\nbecome a beautiful new you.
[~ 246]
[~ 247]
A third serving of defeat, huh...

You’re so strong and cool... I’m real proud to call\nyou my best friend, you know!

The future of Paldea is bright indeed.

Mabosstiff really gave it his all—I know he did!\nAnd next time, we won’t lose!
[~ 264]
[~ 265]
My Veevee power wasn’t enough...
[~ 267]
[~ 268]
Sweat and tears make people and Pokémon\nstronger in the end!
[~ 270]
[~ 271]
Oh, dear. It seems there was an error in my\ncalculations.
[~ 273]
[~ 274]
Shall I add this defeat to the pages of the\nhistory books?
[~ 276]
[~ 277]
Uuugh! Couldn’t you have at least gone a LITTLE\neasy on me?!
[~ 279]
[~ 280]
Perhaps the secret to your strength is a balanced\ndiet?
[~ 282]
[~ 283]
You’ve really been working hard on your study of\nPokémon, haven’t you?
[~ 285]
[~ 286]
What a victory! Tu es incroyable—that is, you’re\nincredible, [VAR 0100(0000)]!

That is the kind of battle that makes me happy I\nbecame a teacher!
[~ 309]
[~ 310]
You are the light that shines upon the people\nof Paldea.
[~ 312]
[~ 313]
One plus one is two, right? ...Right?
[~ 315]
[~ 316]
That wasn’t harmony—it was cacophony...
[~ 318]
[~ 319]
It was YOU who sledged ME up!
[~ 321]
Hey, let’s battle! ▶
If you talk to a Pokémon Trainer like me, it means\nwe’re gonna battle!
Your Pokémon are strong, huh!
Here in Paldea, you gotta talk to a Pokémon\nTrainer to challenge ’em. We can’t tell if you\r\nwanna battle just by making eye contact!
Got my Pokémon\nall healed up! ▶
If you can beat me, I’ll tell you a cool secret!
Awww, I lost... Even though my Pokémon had\nfull HP...
Here’s the secret: Pokémon Centers will heal all\nyour Pokémon...for FREE!\c\nWhat do you mean, you already knew that?!
I bought everything I need.\nI’m all set! ▶
Perfect timing! You wanted to challenge me to a\nPokémon battle, right?
Ooof. I stepped up and got smacked down.
Guess I better heal up my Pokémon. Good thing\nI bought these Potions at the Poké Mart...
What a cool Pokémon! ▶
Lemme show you this awesome-lookin’ Pokémon\nI just caught!
I guess just looking cool doesn’t cut it.
I caught my Chewtle pretty close to a pond.\nMaybe Water types like hanging out near water...
Gotta get stronger! ▶
I’m gonna defeat you so my Pokémon can get\neven tougher!
Maybe my Pokémon’s level isn’t high enough...
The more you battle, the more you can raise your\nPokémon’s levels! Ever stronger!
Heh heh heh!\nI’ve got TWO! ▶
I got two whole Pokémon! Am I cool or what?
Waaah! My two Pokémon!
When you battle, the Pokémon at the top of your\nteam gets sent out first! Every Pokémon Trainer’s\r\ngotta know that!
Heading to school? ▶
Got time to battle a fella like me on your way\nto school?
Safe trip, then!
This road’ll take you right to Mesagoza, where\nthe school is! Don’t get lost, now.
Hiking’s real simple! ▶
I’ll tell you all you need to know about hiking!\nRule one: Work those legs!\r\nRule two: Work those legs!!!
You wanna know the third and fourth rules?\nThere are none! It’s all legs, kiddo!
Climbing mountains means tackling some slopes!\c\nI’m sure even a kiddo like you can make it up a\nhill like the one leading into Mesagoza, if you try!
Any Trainer worth\ntheir salt knows... ▶
Pop quiz! What happens when a Pokémon’s HP\nruns out?
The answer is, as you can see...they get too\nexhausted to fight!
When a Pokémon loses all its HP and faints, you\ncan’t make it better with a Potion. You’ve got to\r\ntake it to a Pokémon Center!
Guess this is it? ▶
I came to Mesagoza to make some deliveries...\nbut let’s have a quick battle!
Guess I delivered you a win!
Mesagoza’s so massive, it’s easy to get lost if you\ndon’t check your map app.
That door was\nso weird... ▶
I can’t stop wondering what’s behind that weird\ndoor, or lid, or cover, or whatever it was...\c\nMaybe a battle will take my mind off it!
Just what could be behind that— Whoa, wait,\nI lost?!
In a rock face past here, there’s a door or lid or\nsomething that’s chained shut!\c\nThere was a faint light coming through it. I\nwonder what could be in there...
I’m the strongest in Area One\nof the South Province! ▶
Do you think you can topple me—the mightiest\nmartial artist here?!
Very well! Henceforth, I am the second mightiest!
I wonder if there are people even stronger than\nus outside Area One of the South Province...
The Pokémon League\nbuilding looks so cool! ▶
I’m makin’ my way to the Pokémon League! Let’s\nbattle to mark the occasion!
Well, losing’s one way to mark an occasion!
I don’t have any Gym Badges yet, but maybe I’ll\nsit for the interview and see if I pass anyway...
Takin’ on the League? ▶
You look like you’ve got promise, kid. Let’s give\nyou a challenge to grow on!
Hahaha! Did you get some growth out of that?
If battling me helps you grow stronger and you\nbecome a Champion one day, that means I’m a\r\npart of what made you a Champion! Right?
Rrrgh! I’m so careless! ▶
I can’t believe I forgot to buy ingredients! Maybe\na rumble will calm my rumbling tummy!
Rrrgh. I’m so disappointed.
I was really excited to have a picnic, make a\nsandwich, and eat it with my Pokémon...
Hey, you there! ▶
I hope you’re getting enough to eat!
Good! You seem well!
When you need a bite, have a sandwich!\c\nYou ought to stock up on ingredients so you can\nmake one anytime!
Gonna train up my bug\nPokémon real strong! ▶
I’m out getting my bug Pokémon a lot of\nexperience!
Aww, I bet I coulda beat you if I’d evolved my\nPokémon...
I hear bug Pokémon evolve quicker than other\nPokémon! Maybe my Kricketot will evolve soon...
Have you seen the\nTen Sights of Paldea? ▶
Want to know the way to one of the Ten Sights\nof Paldea?!
This is a sight I’ve never seen!
The Grand Olive Orchard, one of the Ten Sights\nof Paldea, is a little past that Pokémon Center!\r\nJust follow the path—you can’t miss it.
What a haul! ▶
I collected a ton of materials Pokémon dropped.\nNow I think I’ll start collecting some prize money!
Fine, you can have some prize money... But you\ncan’t have my materials!
I need to make some TMs. That’s why I was out\ngathering materials that Pokémon drop.
Which way to the Gym? ▶
Check me out—I’m 60 and still kickin’! I’m even\noff to take on a Gym!
Check me out—I’m 60 and getting beat before\nI even get to the Gym...
My daughter keeps telling me, “If you get lost,\npress the Y Button to check your map app!”\r\nMap app? Sounds like claptrap to me...
I wanna catch ’em! ▶
Could I catch the Pokémon you trained?\nPleeease, could I?
Guess you can’t catch people’s Pokémon...
I don’t want to be a thief! I’ll just catch wild\nPokémon.
Please tell me the way! ▶
Where am I supposed to go from here? I haven’t\ngot a clue—I’m just aimlessly wandering...
Was losing to you supposed to help me find\nmy way?!
If you get lost and don’t know where to go, like\nme...try asking at the Pokémon Center.
Hey, are we\nschoolmates?! ▶
You go to the academy too, right? Let’s pool our\nknowledge and trade tips...after we battle!
How do you know so much more than me when\nwe’ve been taking the same classes?!
Across the river, you’ll find the South Province’s\nArea Four. It’s got stronger Pokémon than here!
Do you have one? ▶
You’ve got a Tera Orb, right?! That’s so cool!\nLemme see, lemme see, lemme see!
So sparkly I got distracted!
Some Pokémon change into different types when\nthey Terastallize, right?\c\nI wish I had a Scatterbug that could turn into a\nFire type. That’d be so cool...
Pokémon quiz tiiime! ▶
What’s two feet, four inches tall and weighs\n45.2 pounds?
Did you figure out the answer?
You should have Gible registered in your\nPokédex now, thanks to our battle! Check out its\r\nhabitat and see if you can catch one!
Oh, happy day! ♪ ▶
I bought some delicious cake from Patisserie\nSoapberry! Let’s celebrate with a battle!
This cake makes me so happy, I don’t even\nmind losing!
Katy, who runs Patisserie Soapberry, is the best\npatissier around. And she’s even a Gym Leader!
Welcome! ▶
Can I interest you in our daily battle special?\nOur regulars say it’s electrifying!
That’s it. I’m closing up shop.
Lots of customers have to go buy a Paralyze Heal\nafter they try my battle special. Hee hee!
I’m so curious about\nTeam Star... ▶
You go to the academy, right? Do you know\nabout Team Star?
I was so busy thinking about Team Star, I lost...
I hear Team Star builds bases and claims whole\nlittle zones for themselves.
You a new kid? ▶
Hey, new kid! I know what’s up around here.\nLemme take a look at your Pokémon for ya!
OK, that was legit hilarious!
Check out these words of wisdom: Those big\nPokémon Center signs make great landmarks.\r\nMakes you less likely to end up lost!
You know the\nArtazon Gym? ▶
Have you been to the Artazon Gym? I sure have!
The tragedy I went through at the Artazon Gym\nhas struck again!
The Gym Leader, Brassius, absolutely wiped the\nfloor with me.
Sparkle, sparkle!\nTwinkle, twinkle! ▶
Hey! I gotta tell you about this! It was all\nsparkly...and all twinkly!
Now we’re all bruise-y and lose-y.
I saw this sparkly Pokémon and I went up to try\nand catch it...when it suddenly Terastallized!
Dun, dun, dun-da-dun! ♪ ▶
Dun, dun, dun-da-dun! ♪ That’s the sound of\nhealing up at the Pokémon Center!
Guess I better go ask for another round of\ndun, dun, dun-da-dun...
Maybe I ought to buy some Potions while I’m at\nthe Pokémon Center.
Let’s show each other\nwhat we’ve got! ▶
Here, I’ll show you my Pokémon first!
I got shown more than I bargained for...
Pokémon you see in battle get registered in your\nPokédex app, so I try to battle a lot.
I’m gonna scare\n’em so bad! ▶
Suddenly, from the bushes... BOO!!! Ha! Bet you\nnever saw that coming!
I lost?! I didn’t see that coming at all!
Maybe something good’ll happen if I sneak up\non a Pokémon that doesn’t see me coming...
It was incredible! ▶
There was—! That rock wall—! There was a—!\nThat Pokémon—! Incredible! You know?!
I think losing to you has calmed me down.
I was leaning on this rock wall, and suddenly it\njust started...moving! It scuttled up the cliff!\c\nWas that thing I thought was a wall...a Pokémon?
Treasure hunting... ▶
You’re doing the Treasure Hunt, aren’t you? I did\nit too, back in the day.
Ah, to be young...
The Treasure Hunt’s basically tradition at\nthe academy.
I want a jolt of\ninspiration! ▶
I want to write a song, but it just won’t come to\nme... I need some kind of spark!
Now THERE’S a spark!
I bet I can write a fine song with that jolt of\ninspiration you gave me!
Heeey! Guess! ▶
Hey! Guess who my favorite teacher at the\nacademy is?
Iiit’s...Mr. Jacq!
You’re in Mr. Jacq’s class?! Lucky!
Well, for now... ▶
For now...let’s battle!
I lost...for now!
I’ve got no idea what to do on my Treasure Hunt.\nFor now, I just gotta figure out the next step...
Battle me,\nfor I am mighty! ▶
Battle me, for I have given my Pokémon a mighty\nitem to hold...and I am mighty!
My might and my items meant nothing in the face\nof a mighty Trainer like you!
I gave one of my Pokémon some Leftovers to\nhold so it’d recover HP bit by bit!\c\nYou can spot mighty Trainers like me by how we\nspeak. Our strength colors everything we say.
Makin’ the rounds,\nround and round... ▶
I’m out making the rounds! Which means I’m on\nthe job, but I’m out and about!
My surroundings are spinning round and round...
It’s kinda nice to get to be outside while I’m\nat work.
I need a model\nfor my new work... ▶
I think my next work shall be a portrait...of you,\ncollapsed in defeat!
Battle... Art... Both are fiendishly tough pursuits!
I still need to find a model for my next piece.\nPreferably someone I can beat.
It’s all about balance! ▶
I’ve got Pokémon of a bunch of different types,\nso we can have a well-balanced battle!
Agh! Now I’m off-balance!
Having different types of Pokémon with you\nshould help you handle different situations!
The Treasure Hunt\nis so much fun! ▶
I’m doing the Treasure Hunt, too. And no fresh-\nfaced kid is gonna beat me!
If that’s how you battle, I’m sure you’ll be able to\nfind your treasure!
No matter how old you get, having new life\nexperiences is always a treasure!
Come say hi!\nCome say hiii! ▶
Yaaay! You came! So, wanna baddle?
You baddle really good!
When someone says somefin’ that gets your\nattention, you just gotta talk to ’em, right?
My own secret base! ▶
This right here is my secret base! I’m gonna beat\nyou and then you gotta go!
What?! Wait, does this mean I have to go?!
It’s tough getting all the way up here to our\nsecret base, huh?
Scrub-a-dub! ▶
Are you washing your Pokémon nice and clean?
I got washed away!
Area Four of the South Province is a big place—\nplenty of room for a thorough Pokémon washing!\r\nA little of that fresh feeling goes a long way!
Begging your pardon... ▶
Begging your pardon... Could I trouble you for\na battle?
I’m begging your par-done for!
I guess in those old-timey shows, when people\nbeg someone’s pardon, they’re usually asking for\r\nhelp or directions or something, not a battle.
I’ve covered up\nmy weakness! ▶
This Berry is my ace in the hole! It’s covered up\nmy weakness!
Even with one less weakness, I lost...
There’re some Berries that Pokémon can hold to\ntake less damage from a supereffective move.\r\nGives you one less thing to worry about!
Treasure ahoy! ▶
I know where there’s treasure! Maaaybe I’ll tell\nyou...if you can beat me!
The real treasure was definitely not meeting you!
I saw a treasure chest up on top of that tower!\nBut it started moving around on its own, so I, uh,\r\ngot kinda freaked out and didn’t open it...
Good ol’ Pokédex! ▶
I love filling in my Pokédex! Don’t you?
I don’t love battles quite as much.
Your Pokédex will tell you where Pokémon’s\nhabitats are and when you might find them!
I wanna see! ▶
I wanna see the cute li’l Pokémon you’ve got\nwith you!
Awww! What [VAR 1101(00FD,0607)]a cutiecuties!
There’re so many kinds of Pokémon! And they’re\nso cute!
Is this a dead end? ▶
It feels like such a waste to hit a dead end and\njust turn back with nothing to show. So...shall we?
I should have just turned back...
If I just had a way to ride a Pokémon up cliffs,\nI could get to the South Province’s Area Six...
Excuse me! ▶
Let’s get down to it. Please forgive my being\nbarefoot.
Perhaps I’d have had a chance if I’d been\nwearing boots...
I know other Black Belts go around barefoot...\nDo rocks and things just not hurt them?
Are these Pokémon\njust too strong? ▶
Is it me, or are the Pokémon around here way too\nstrong? We should probably turn back, huh?
I guess I’d be fine out here if I were as strong as\nyou are.
Beating stronger Pokémon makes you stronger in\nturn, but that only works if you can actually win...
Two whole decades! ▶
I’ve got twenty years of studies at the academy\nunder my belt!
Twenty years...for this...
I was so short on credits I had to take a 20th\nyear! Maybe it’s time I graduated...
If you shorten pants... ▶
If you shorten pants, do you get a pan?
Now I’ve got short pants, but a long face...
Would you say you’re more of a shorts person or\na pants person?
How about it? ▶
How about a nice Pokémon battle? I’ve got some\nspare time and I’d like to do something fun!
Ahhh, that was fun.
Some moves look cool, some moves hit hard...but\nmy favorites are the ones that are just plain fun.
Do you know of Kofu? ▶
Kofu, the Cascarrafa Gym Leader, is quite strong!
I guess now you know how strong I am!
Kofu is a user of water Pokémon! Take care lest\nyou be swept away by his strategy!
The Great Crater\nof Paldea... ▶
Why is the Great Crater of Paldea off-limits,\nI wonder?
Guess if a kid can beat me, I’m better off not\ngoing anywhere dangerous...
I heard the depths of the Great Crater of Paldea\nare defended by a super-powerful guardian!
I’ve got a guitar... ▶
I’ve got a guitar that doesn’t make a sound!
I’m as victorious as my guitar is loud...
Sometimes I carry around my silent guitar to\ntoughen up my arms and neck!
The joy of youth! ▶
What is youth, though? Do you have an answer?
Aaah, the folly of youth...
Maybe you only really understand your youth\nwhen you look back on it as an adult.
A weird Pokémon! ▶
There was a weird Pokémon! There was a weird\nPokémon!
I saw a weird Pokémon, I swear! I’ll tell you more\nin a bit!
I ran into a weird Pokémon out in the desert.\c\nIt looked like Donphan, but I think it actually\nwas a different Pokémon...
So much sand! ▶
What d’you think will happen if sand gets into\nmy shoes?
Maybe I’ll just go bury my head in the sand!
If the sand stays inside my shoes for too long,\nI start to grow fond of it!
Yooo-hooo! ▶
Yaaa! Huagh?! Hey, how’d you get up here?!
Oooh, by riding your Pokémon!
Your Pokémon climbed up here, right?\n...Wait, can Cyclizar climb?
I’m a worker! ▶
I’m a worker! If you need work done, I’m\nyour man!
Pokémon battles aren’t work!
Workers like me can build any kind of building,\nwhether it’s a school or the Pokémon League HQ!
Teach me! ▶
Teach me! Teach me the feeling of defeat!
So this is what defeat feels like!
Defeat’s really something else. Thanks for\nteaching me!
Don’t worry! I’ve got it! ▶
Yes, I’ll take care of this mess... I’ll clean you out!
You’ve cleaned me out!
No matter how messy battles get, I love to\nsee them!
[~ 594]
[~ 595]
[~ 596]
[~ 597]
I forgot to do\nmy homework! ▶
I forgot to do my homework! If I win, you gotta\nlet me copy yours!
Wait, we’re not even in the same class...
So, which classes are you taking? I’m in, like,\nbattle studies and biology and stuff!
Hikers are super popular! ▶
I heard that I’d be super popular if I became\na Hiker!
Hiking up the mountain of popularity!
I guess Hikers are popular with Pokémon. I’m OK\nwith that!
I spy a mountain! ▶
A mountain of an opponent! Let me reach\nyour summit!
Coming down off the mountain...
I guess you were too much of a mountain for me!
[~ 610]
[~ 611]
[~ 612]
[~ 613]
I have this really\ncool classmate! ▶
I have a classmate whose [VAR 1107(00FF,0303)]momdad is a famous\nprofessor!
There’s nothing particularly cool about me.
Don’t you think it’d be cool to have a parent\nthat’s famous?
[~ 618]
[~ 619]
[~ 620]
[~ 621]
She was so strong... ▶
A superstrong girl asked me to battle! I lost\nbefore I could even blink!
And now I lost to you, too!
That superstrong girl... She had to be Champion\nRank. No doubt about it.
Rarrr! Raaarrrr! ▶
Do you wanna see my super cool Pokémon\nfigurines?
Grrryaaa! Craaash! I lost!
Your Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare super neat! If they ever make\n[VAR 1101(00FD,0E0E)]a figure of itfigures of ’em, you bet I’ll collect [VAR 1101(00FD,0C01)]ithe whole set!
It doesn’t matter. ▶
It doesn’t matter how old you are if your\nPokémon are strong.
You’re strong! And young!
With Pokémon, a child can defeat an adult!\nThat’s what makes it so fun!
[~ 634]
[~ 635]
[~ 636]
[~ 637]
Where did you\ncome from? ▶
Oh, you’re from Cabo Poco? I’m from\nMontenevera!
I was representing Montenevera but I still lost...
The snow in Montenevera is gorgeous! And we\nhave a beautiful concert stage too!\c\nI bet Cabo Poco doesn’t have all that!
Which do you like? ▶
Do you like studying in the classroom? Or do you\nlike adventuring in the wild?
Well, I can tell you definitely like Pokémon.
Me, I prefer to stay in my classroom and study!
Hoo hah! ▶
Hoo hah! Hoo hah!
I guess just shouting wasn’t enough to win.
Hoo hah!\nI tried copying the shouts of a martial artist I\r\nlook up to, but I couldn’t win anyway.
Monsters! ▶
I love Pokémon that are like the monsters\nin movies!
I can’t believe my monster was defeated!
In the movies, the monsters always lose. But in\nreal life I’d like them to win!
I want to protect\nthis beach. ▶
Hey, did I just catch you littering?! I need to\nbattle you to protect the beach!
Sorry about that... Seems like I was mistaken.
This is the Secluded Beach, one of the Ten\nSights of Paldea.\c\nIt’s not so secluded anymore, what with all the\nattention it’s gotten as a tourist location...
[~ 658]
[~ 659]
[~ 660]
[~ 661]
I need your help! ▶
I need a real workout!
Now that was a good workout! I was sweating\na ton!
Pokémon battles are great exercise for the\nTrainers, too! It’s just the best!
... ... ... ▶
...Let’s battle.
...You’re strong.
That was fun... Bye...
Where’s Alfornada? ▶
Let’s have a battle. It’ll help me feel less alone\nand lost.
I lost. This does nothing to help my anxiety.
Supposedly, I can reach Alfornada if I just follow\nthe road, but...is this even a road...?
What a great view! ▶
I wanna get a selfie of me beating you with this\ngorgeous view as a backdrop!
A selfie of my defeat, huh?
I wanted a selfie so I could use it for my icon\non my profile!
Focus! Gotta focus! ▶
I lost at the Alfornada Gym so I’m doing some\nmore training.
Yet another defeat!
Tulip, the Alfornada Gym Leader, is a skilled\nTrainer of Psychic-type Pokémon.\c\nMy Fighting-type Pokémon didn’t stand\na chance...
Putting my trained\nlegs to use! ▶
One! Two!\nOne! Two!\c\nI trained using the torturously long staircase in\nfront of the school!
I wish training my legs also made my Pokémon\nstronger.
That staircase in front of the school sure is\nridiculously long, isn’t it?\c\nYou can catch the student council president\nsitting down for a breather from time to time.
I’m so worried! ▶
A child, out all on your own? Why, you have me\nworried sick! I’ve got to get you back to town!
Oh, well, if you’re that strong, I suppose I\nneedn’t worry.
Watch out for dangerous Pokémon and strange\npeople, OK?
This slope is awesome! ▶
This is an absolute paradise for us hikers!
It’s like I’m climbing into the sky!
Flat paths are so boring. Just like life, you gotta\nhave peaks and valleys!
Your future is hazy. ▶
Let me see your future. Let’s see if you’ll make it\nout of this cave!
You’ll be fine wherever you go...
Alfornada is ahead, after you climb this cave\never upward.\c\nFollow the torches. They will be your guide.
Where am I? ▶
I was running after Pokémon and...now I’m\ncompletely lost!
Lost my way to victory too...
If I really get stumped, I’ll call a Flying Taxi.
Whew... Just a\nlittle more... ▶
I swore to myself that I’d make my way to town\nwithout riding on my Pokémon.
My legs are about to give out, and I’m about to\ngive up...
I guess it’s a good time for a breather! And I’ve\ngot some sandwiches for my Pokémon!
This is so much fun! ▶
Treasure hunting is so much fun! And it’ll be even\nmore fun when I beat you!
Losing isn’t fun!
This Treasure Hunt project is fun, isn’t it?\c\nIt’s a great chance to really reexamine yourself!
Gotta remember\nPokémon types... ▶
Pokémon types are so complicated, don’t\nyou think?
Not complicated for you, huh?
OK, so I get why Water is strong against Fire...\nBut why is Dark strong against Psychic?
So much work! ▶
*huff* *puff*\nIt’s so much work to get to town from here!
I bet I’d have won if I wasn’t so tired.
I wish they’d give me a bonus for each delivery\nI make to Alfornada.
Did I see you riding\non a Pokémon? ▶
I didn’t know there was a Pokémon that could\nclimb these steep slopes with a rider...
I thought I’d trained pretty hard...
Such a mysterious Pokémon... I’ve never seen\nanything like it!
Behold these muscles! ▶
I built up these muscles by many trips to the gym!\nMy brilliant brawn will surely lead me to victory!
My massive musculature misled me!
The gym I go to isn’t a Pokémon Gym, you know!\nIt’s a human gym!
How does today’s\nweather look? ▶
I’ll tell you why I’m so worried about the weather!
Sandstorms are weather too, you know!\n...I swear! They are!
The truly frightening thing about a sandstorm is\nnot the damage it deals...\c\nit’s the fact that Rock-type Pokémon get a\nSp. Def boost and become even hardier!
’Scuse me! ▶
Wouldja be so kind as to battle me? As, like,\ncelebration for reaching Alfornada?
Wait...this isn’t Alfornada?
You’re saying Alfornada is beyond Alfornada\nCavern...? I need to climb even more?!
Map says it’s around\nhere somewhere... ▶
You wouldn’t happen to know the address for the\nTeam Star Poison crew’s base, would you?
I misread the map, and I misread the course of\nthat battle!
It seems like Team Star’s Poison crew set up their\nbase across the river.
Gotta study hard! ▶
Hey, aren’t you a student?! You should be at\nschool!
You schooled me!
You should go back to the academy now and\nthen to attend class. You’ll learn a lot!
What colorful trees... ▶
Do you know why these trees have so many\ncolors on them?
Waaaaaah! Now I’m all bluuueee!
The colorful markings on these trees were\npainted by a Pokémon called Grafaiai.\r\nThat Pokémon is a real artist. Just like me!
Heeey, you wanna\nbuy this? ▶
Oh ho ho! You bought it—my fake out, that is!\nNow it’s battle time!
That little joke really cost me!
Did you know that shops will buy your items? But\nyou’ll only get a quarter what you’d pay for ’em.\c\nIf you want to make money, sell items like\nNuggets—that’s really all they’re good for!
Ahhh, Steel-type Pokémon! ▶
I’ll show you how strong and sturdy Steel-type\nPokémon can be!
Did you already know how to get around\nSteel-type Pokémon’s sturdy strength?
Steel types don’t have all that many weaknesses,\nand they can’t be poisoned!\c\nThey get KAPOW’ed by Fighting-type moves,\nthough...plus Fire-type moves melt them down!
This is Area Three of\nthe East Province! ▶
Area Three of the East Province is a mining belt!\nWe dig, dig, dig for metals!
I see you’re no stranger to hard work!
Maybe this is a good time for me to head back\nto Zapapico and rest up!
So, about those mines... ▶
Do you think people can go hiking in mines?
I guess you wouldn’t know, huh?
No matter the reason, kids like you should stay\noutta mines! You’re a minor, not a miner!
My Pokémon!\nIt evooolved! ▶
Want to help my newly evolved Pokémon with\nsome target practice?
My Pokémon’s so newly evolved, it doesn’t\nknow how to battle!
It’s amazing how Magikarp evolves into Gyarados.\nI wish I could evolve into a Pokémon, too...
Ptooey! Blech... ▶
There’s so much sand around here, my mouth’s\ngetting all gritty...
What, the battle’s over? I was still spitting\nout sand...
Even sandstorms won’t give you any trouble if\nyou’ve got Safety Goggles in hand!\r\nThe sand will still get in your mouth though!
Harsh landscapes\nare the best! ▶
Harsh landscapes like this are the best for\ngood-quality training!
So harsh!!!
What would happen if I trained on a tropical\nbeach instead? Would it be...not very effective?
Gosh, it was amazing! ▶
Oh my gosh, I saw something amazing! Wanna\nknow what it was?
I saw an amaaazing Pokémon right here!
A huuuge Pokémon like one of those big towers\nin Levincia came right out of the ground!\c\nIt looked just like the giant Diglett statues they\nhave in some other region!
Ah, sad songs... ▶
Are you a fan of sad songs? Or not so much?\nMy personal opinion is...they’re OK, I guess!
It’s a sad, sad loss in a sad, sad world. ♪\nTra la la laaa. ♪
Just a theory of mine, but I think cheery people\ntend to be more fond of sad songs!
Tick-tock-tick-tock. ▶
Come on! Let’s have a battle of luck!
Is your luck good? Or is mine just bad?
Metronome is a move that leaves everything to\nluck! So it wasn’t my skill that failed me.
Let’s talk about me! ▶
Hey! Don’t you think I’m awful cute?
I wish you’d show a little more respect for my\ncuteness.
Maybe I should have spent more time making my\nPokémon really cute?
I’ll see if you’re worthy. ▶
Are you a student, child? Allow me to test your\nabilities!
That was conceited of me...
My apologies. You were the superior Trainer.
You got moxie, kid? ▶
I want to battle someone with serious moxie! Are\nyou that someone?
You outmoxied me!
That was the best battle I’ve had in a while!\nThanks for talking to me, kid!
Everything here’s\nso rugged... ▶
Seems rough and rugged places like this attract\na lot of hardy Pokémon, huh?
Wow! The Trainers are hardy, too!
If I want to find soft, fluffy Pokémon, should I\nlook in a flower meadow or something?
Hey! Hold up,\nwould you? ▶
Tagtree Thicket up ahead isn’t safe—you’ll run\ninto a bunch of delinquents.
Wow, you’re strong. I guess you didn’t need\nmy advice!
They’re from a group called Team Star? People\nsay they’re delinquents, right? Not that they’ve\r\ndone anything to me, mind you, but still...
What Pokémon do\nyou think I’ll use? ▶
Did you talk to me because you thought I’d use\nDragon-type Pokémon?
You were right! It’s dragons all the way!
Maybe this outfit isn’t doing me any good.\nEveryone can tell which type I’ll be using...
Any day now! ▶
My baby is due any day now! I gotta get serious!
I wish I could’ve gotten a bit more serious in\nthat battle!
When my kid is old enough, I’ll be sure to send\nthem to the same school you go to!
According to my\ncalculations... ▶
I calculated it all, and I knew the likelihood you’d\ncome talk to me was 100 percent!
I failed to calculate my chances of winning...
Do you have lessons with Ms. Tyme?\nThey’re really fun if you love math!
He loves me...\nHe loves me not... ▶
If I beat you, I’m gonna tell my crush how I feel!
I lost! Oh, thank goodness!
At this rate, I’ll always be holding back on\nmaking any decisive moves...
In cold places\nlike this... ▶
In cold places like this, my life gets a bit easier!
Only my deliveries get easier, you know!\nBattling’s as tough as always!
The food I’m delivering doesn’t spoil when it’s\ncold out. For once, I’m not rushed off my feet!
Ah... Aaah! ▶
ACHOOOOOOOOO!!!\nUm... That was my battle cry!
Choo...
I’m trying to get to the Glaseado Gym, but boy\nis it cold here!
Here’s the thing\nabout Paldea... ▶
Paldea has all sorts of different climates,\ndepending on where you go!
Brrrrrr!
It’s so cold in this area! Anyone without warm\nwinter clothes is gonna have a tough time.

The snow’s\na-fallin’ down! ▶
Hey there! Want me ta tell ya the best thing\n’bout the snowy peaks?
Yer strong, that’s fer sure...
It’s Ice-type Pokémon, o’ course! There’s tons\nof ’em up in the snow!
I gotta get to\nthat concert! ▶
I heard that Ryme, the world-famous rapper, is\nhaving a concert over in Montenevera!
I’m gonna miss the concert!
Don’t tell me...Montenevera is on the OTHER\nside of the mountain?
You heard of the\nSnow Slope Run? ▶
I traveled a long way to get here so I could\ntry my hand at the Snow Slope Run.
Battling is also a slippery slope.
For my Treasure Hunt, I’m gonna get the world\nrecord in the Snow Slope Run! Ehehehe...
Oh, my dear Grusha... ▶
Grusha used to be a pro snowboarder, you know.\nI came here to meet him, but now I’m lost!
Grushaaa! Where are yooouuu?
I suppose if I head toward the mountain peak, I’ll\neventually spot the Glaseado Gym, where my\r\ndear Grusha awaits me...
I sense a strong aura... ▶
Your Pokémon seem[VAR 1101(00FD,0001)]s really strong! I wanna\nbattle [VAR 1101(00FD,0402)]itthem!
So I was right!
If you made it all the way out here, you’ve gotta\nbe strong for sure.
Woo-hoo! ▶
I was born up north, so I get excited when I\ncome to cold places like this.
You left me out in the cold!
It’s amazing what a difference it makes when you\nprotect your head and ears against the cold!
A little more\nrespect, please? ▶
Hey, you! You’re not treatin’ the mountain with\nthe respect it deserves!
Just a little bit is all I’m askin’...
You can never be overprepared for a hike! Bring\nall the items you can carry—and then some!
Oh! It’s someone\nfrom school... ▶
It’s kind of embarrassing bumping into your\nschoolmates outside of school, huh?
I lost... Now I’m even more embarrassed.
I hate running into people I know when I’m out\nand about. It’s weird, I know.
Thick Fat is\nwhere it’s at! ▶
My protective layer of fat keeps me nice and\ntoasty even out in the cold!
Being nice and toasty didn’t help me win...
Pokémon with the Thick Fat Ability receive less\ndamage from Fire- and Ice-type moves!
This is the perfect\nplace to train! ▶
I come to harsh environments like this to train my\nbody and soul. That’s just my style!
My Pokémon and I were too busy hunkering\ndown against the cold.
The body temperatures of most Dragon types\nvary greatly with their environment.\c\nThat’s why they don’t handle ice and snow all\nthat well.
What is art? ▶
What is art? I...I don’t even know anymore.
That last move of yours was pure art!
I feel motivation welling up inside me! Cheers for\nthe battle!
Careful there,\nyoung one. ▶
You ought to be careful. There’s no shortage of\nstrong Trainers in these parts.
I suppose none of the other Trainers were as\nstrong as you.
A weak Trainer could never make it up here.\nI apologize for judging you prematurely.
I’ll use the snow! ▶
I’m going to use snow to make art! That’s why I\ncame up here!
Oh nooo! I just realized something!
Any art that I make out of snow is going to melt\nas soon as I take it with me off this mountain!\r\nArgh! Back to square one.
Time to whip out\nmy camera app! ▶
I’ll take an awesome video of this battle with my\ncamera app! It’s gonna blow up everyone’s feeds!
I...I can’t post this.
My posts never get any likes or comments. Is it\nbecause I don’t have any followers?

Clear your mind... ▶
If you clear your mind of all worldly thoughts,\neven fire will feel cool!
Brrrrrr... C-c-clear y-y-your m-m-mind...
Snow still feels cold even if you clear your mind!\nWhat gives?!
YODEL-AY-HEE-HOOO! ▶
YODEL-AY-HEE-HOOO!\nWah! Who are you?!
No, really! Who ARE you?!
I like how you can “yodel-ay-hee-hoo” up here\nand get a “yodel-ay-hee-hoo” right back!\r\nWonder who’s doing the responding.
I wanna be a hiker! ▶
Hikers are great! So strong and free and cool!
Being strong and free is tough...
Mountains are dangerous, huh? Maybe I’ll head\nto the forests instead!
White snow all around... ▶
White snow all around... ♪\nI cross paths with a schoolkid... ♪\r\nArgh, I can’t come up with the last line!
A bitter defeat... ♪
I came here to compose haiku, but only wintry\nverses are springing to mind.
KAPOW! ▶
All opponents will meet my fists of fury!\nKAPOW! KABLAM!
Kapow... Ka...kablam...\nOwie. That hurts.
Guess it doesn’t matter how much I train my fists\nof fury—they’re no good in Pokémon battles.
Mi-mi-miiiiii! ♪\nMa-ma-maaa! ♪ ▶
Glaseado Mountain has such nice, fresh air!\nI can sing so well up here!
That’s all from me-me-me-meeeeee! ♪\n...Oh! I struck that note beautifully!
I might cause an avalanche if I sing too\nloudly, huh?
’Sup! ▶
’Sup! Wild Bull Transport, at your service!\nWhat say we have a quick battle?
Errr! Guess I wasn’t wild enough!
Wild Bull Transport has Tauros as our mascot!\nNeed goods delivered? Our Tauros-strength\r\nmuscles will get it there!
Oh! ▶
I’ve seen you around school! You’re that new\ntransfer student, aren’t you?
This new kid’s really shaking things up...
You’re a strong one, new kid! We’re not in the\nsame year, but I’ll see you around the academy!
Those pillars of light... ▶
Have you ever seen one of those pillars of light?\nYou can spot them even from far away!
Hrrrmmm... Too bright!
If you check out pillars of light, you can join\nTera Raid Battles and catch Tera Pokémon!

Wind power is big here in Area One of the\nWest Province.
I forgot that kids have unlimited energy.
Wind, hydroelectric, geothermal—all sorts of\nenergy can be generated from nature.
Once I master the\nmartial arts... ▶
Once I master the martial arts...what am I\nsupposed to do afterward?!
I never said I already mastered them!
What to do after mastering the martial arts...\nGuess I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it!

Looking at a big windmill too long makes\nme dizzy!
Hey there! ▶
Hey there! Hey! I’m hitchhiking! Can I catch a\nride on your Pokémon?

If I win... ▶
If I win, you’ve gotta buy my CD!
What? No one buys CDs anymore?!
I guess that’s why I can’t sell my CDs. Everybody\nhas some kind of subscription service!
Looking for research\nparticipants! ▶
Aha! My hypothesis was correct! People in this\nregion talk to each other to start battles!
I guess it’s Paldean culture to approach other\nTrainers and talk to them to engage in battles.
Did you know that there are regions where\nyou have to battle if you make eye contact?
I hope I don’t fall... ▶
Ahhhhhh! You scared me! What?! A battle?!\nY-yeah, OK! Sure!
I’m glad that scare didn’t make me fall.
Even if you fall from high up, your Rotom Phone\nwill save you.\c\nIf you can’t get back to where you fell from, just\ncall a Flying Taxi using your map app!

I won’t lose! ▶
I won’t lose! In terms of being energetic, anyway!
I’m still more energetic than you!
For kids like me, being energetic is just a part of\nwho we are!
The area up ahead\nis dangerous! ▶
The area up ahead is dangerous! The Pokémon\nthere are suuuper strong!
It was YOU I should have been scared of!
The cave up ahead has lots of scary Pokémon!\nIf they’re too strong to handle, you should turn\r\naround and come back.
I started out from\nthe west gate! ▶
Hey! I started out from the west gate\nof Mesagoza!
Did you start out from the west gate too?!
Starting from the west side puts you closer to the\nGyms in Cortondo and Cascarrafa!
Is this for you? ▶
Are you the one who ordered a pizza to be\ndelivered out here?
Just a passerby, huh?
I should’ve listened better when they told me\nwhere to deliver this pizza...
Just call a\nFlying Taxi! ▶
Are you a Pokémon Trainer? Flying Taxi fees are\nwaived for Trainers.
You’re most definitely a Trainer, all right!
The Pokémon League pays the Flying Taxi fares\nfor all Trainers, so take all the rides you like.
So THAT’S a desert... ▶
I’ve always dreamed of seeing a desert with my\nown eyes.
You’re full of energy, huh? Just like the desert.
I’m so glad I had the courage to enroll in the\nacademy. It let me have experiences like this one!
I can’t even get close... ▶
I want to get to the peak, but I can’t even\nget close.
You’re even wilder than the rolling boulders!
I wonder if I could get up to the peak riding on a\nPokémon if I just avoided the boulders?
Team Star... ▶
Watch out for Team Star. They have a real unique\nway of battling.
You’re pretty unique yourself!
I hear Team Star lets their Pokémon call the shots\nagainst their opponents using Auto Battles!

Hey! Let’s talk! ▶
Getting to interact with the locals wherever you\ngo is one of the best parts of traveling.
W-wow! You’re quite the character!
Kids from Paldea are pretty strong, huh?! I hope\nI brought enough Potions...
Guess what’s in\nmy backpack? ▶
Inside my backpack, I have...Pokémon!
Ahhh... I even packed up my best Pokémon!
I keep all sorts of special stuff in my backpack!\nWhat do you keep in yours?
Fighting types\nare the best! ▶
Black Belts just HAVE to choose Fighting-type\nPokémon!
Now that was a tough fight!
We Black Belts love our Fighting-type Pokémon,\nyou know!\c\nSo don’t come at us with Psychic- or Flying-types\nor anything like that!
It was carryin’ a coin! ▶
I’m tryin’a find a widdle Pokémon carryin’ a coin!
I’m tryin’ so hard! But I can’t find it! I just stare\ninto the tall grass...
That widdle coin Pokémon runs away fast! You\ncan’t catch it, but it drops a coin if you find it!
That barricade... ▶
That barricade over there is part of a Team Star\nbase. Team Star is trouble, so battle me instead!
I guess I couldn’t trick you even with such a slick\nbattle invitation...
The boss of Team Star’s Dark crew has a real\nmean look in his eyes.

A lovely prize! ▶
I want a lovely prize! Let’s battle!
Awww. This doesn’t add to my win count!
One of the League staffers at the Pokémon\nCenter told me we could get lovely prizes if we\r\nwin battles against a lot of other Trainers.
I’m just no good... ▶
Ahhh! I’m just no good! No good at all!
See? I told you!
I’m no good as a courier. I always skip out on\nwork to battle. That’s bad, isn’t it?
Brand-spankin’ new! ▶
I’m a brand-spankin’ new Dragon Tamer! I’ll rawr\nat ya with my dragon power!
Aren’t Dragon-types supposed to be strong?!
I guess it’s ME that’s weak, not my Pokémon! I’ll\nwork hard to get stronger!
TMs! Wooo! ▶
I’ve taught my Pokémon all sorts of strong moves\nusing TMs, you know!
I need to make even stronger TMs!
TMs are great because you can teach Pokémon\nmoves they couldn’t learn otherwise.
Casseroya! Casseroya! ▶
Hey! What does Casseroya mean? That’s all I can\nthink about recently!
Wait! I know! Maybe it’s a royal casserole?!
By the way, Casseroya Lake is to the north—but\nyou won’t get very far if you can’t swim!
To the west... ▶
There’s a town to the west! But there’s an\nopponent right in front of you!
You’re strong regardless of what direction you’re\nheaded, huh?!
The market town of Porto Marinada lies to the\nwest! By the way, west is the direction marked in\r\nyellow on the map app.
So strong! So rare! ▶
You want to see my strong and rare Pokémon,\ndon’t you? DON’T YOU?
So strong! So wonderful!
I hear there are Pokémon out there with different\ncoloration than other members of their species.\r\nI sure would like to see one of those someday!
Natuuure! ▶
Let’s have a battle out here surrounded by all this\nsoothing nature!
Well, that wasn’t very soothing...
I’m gonna have a picnic at all the spots in Paldea\nwith good views.
Can you help me? ▶
If I win, can you help me by making my deliveries\nin my stead?
I knew that wouldn’t work!
I guess this loss was the motivation I needed!\nTime to get back to work!
I want... ▶
I want power!
Your power! It’s overwhelming!
How did you get so powerful?
Heeelp! ▶
Heeelp! My hand throws Poké Balls all on its own!
Guess I picked the wrong opponent. Hmph!
I gotta get ready for the next person, so you go\naway, OK? Go!
Top spot! ▶
Mountains are a top spot in my book...because\nthey’re so high up! Get it?
I lost! I did, did I?
Phrases like “top spot” are called palindromes!\nThey read the same forwards and backwards!
I prefer the indoors! ▶
I prefer the indoors, but I came here to see this\namazing sight.
What an amazing sight!
This place is called Colonnade Hollow. It’s one of\nthe Ten Sights of Paldea.\c\nI’m going to research how the area came to be\nshaped this way!
Hey! Do you know... ▶
Hey! Do you know... Do you know how strong\nI am?!
I was just a big fish in a small pond...but you\nshowed me what the ocean is like!
There are people more talented than me all over\nthis great big world of ours, huh?
The ocean is so vast... ▶
Let’s have a battle here with a refreshing\nocean view!
What? This isn’t the ocean? It’s a lake?!
My map app says this body of water is a lake...\nAren’t lakes basically just tiny oceans?
She’s so popular! ▶
Have you heard of the superpopular streamer\nnamed Iono?
Ah! I was going to buy merch with that money!
Iono’s a streamer and a Gym Leader, too! She’s\nalso super cute! You should watch her stuff.
Welcome! ▶
Welcome to the outdoor café! Our special today\nis the taste of defeat—coming right up!
Ah... so THIS is what defeat tastes like!
Defeat doesn’t taste so bad once you get used\nto it. An acquired taste, I suppose?
My Pokémon\nis the cutest! ▶
My Pokémon is obviously the cutest, but my\nfriends just don’t get it!
I don’t mind losing, as long as I got to convey to\nyou how cute Dedenne is!
Some people don’t like Dedenne because it\nsteals electricity. But honestly, being a li’l thief\r\njust makes it even cuter...
You been to Medali? ▶
Medali’s famous Treasure Eatery gets a one-star\nreview from me!
Your battle skill is five stars!
I heard you can change your Pokémon’s Tera\nType at the Treasure Eatery, but that stubborn\r\nchef wouldn’t even give me the time of day!
Behold my illusions! ▶
I will show you the illusion of the century!
You saw right through my illusions!
Zorua’s always disguised as some other Pokémon.\nIt’s really hard to find!
Where’s the\nbattle court...? ▶
I need to make a delivery to Medali’s\nbattle court!
I can’t find my destination OR my way to victory...
Medali has a Gym, but I don’t see a battle\ncourt anywhere!
Work, work, work... ▶
Right! I’ve made up my mind!\nI’ll go to work if I win this battle!
Woooooo! I lost, so I guess I’m taking today off!
Just to be clear, I didn’t lose just so I could take\nthe day off, OK? I would never do that.
When two\nTrainers meet... ▶
A battle is unavoidable when two Trainers meet!
Where there’s a victor, there’s also a loser.
Battling you reminded me of how I used to be—\npicking fights with everyone I came across.
The ice cream vendor... ▶
The ice cream vendor at Medali was selling\nsomething mighty strange.
That wasn’t very sweet of you!
I didn’t know modern ice cream vendors had such\nsalty-sweet ice cream!
Hee hee hee! ▶
Hee hee hee! I’m kinda the main attraction at\nmy café!
Hey! Don’t steal my appeal!
I’m the adorable battling barista! Hope to see\nyou at the café sometime!
My Pokémon is\nobviously the cutest! ▶
Wanna know the cutest Pokémon of them all?\n’Cause I’m gonna tell you!
Allow me to illustrate for you the many qualities\nthat make Pawmo such a cute— Wait, I lost?
OK, so, what makes Pawmo so cute is how it\nhustles its little heart to keep up when you’ve got\r\nit walking around with you—and ohmygosh,\r\nI even heard that if you walk with it enough,\r\nit might even evolve, and I just absolutely\r\nCANNOT EVEN with how cute it is! Hee hee!
Could you be...? ▶
Could you be...what I’m here to clean up?
You wiped the floor with me...
My mistake—I took you for someone else.\nNow go away and don’t talk to me.
If I had to pick... ▶
If I had to pick between the hike up a mountain\nand the hike down...the hike down’s more fun!
I took a steep fall!
When two people on a mountain trail pass each\nother, the one going up has the right of way!
We’ve got to\nsynergize! ▶
We’ve got to synergize across all metrics! Let’s\npivot and take this offline.
We need to circle back on this...
You really leveraged your core competencies.\nI need to drill down on improving...
Talk to me! ▶
Hey, you talked to me! Thanks. Now let’s battle!
Wow, you’re bold!
I guess you wouldn’t have come talk to me if you\nweren’t confident in your battle skills...
I think my Pokémon\nis the cutest. ▶
You seem to have a discerning eye. Have a look\nat the cutest Pokémon there is!
Ah, how utterly adorable Bergmite looks when\nit’s defeated...
It’s plain as day that Bergmite’s the cutest of all,\nbut my friends just don’t see it.\c\nAnyway, you can find Bergmite on Glaseado\nMountain. You ought to catch one for yourself!
It’s gotta be nearby... ▶
They say there’s a tunnel around here that leads\ninto the Great Crater of Paldea!
Looks like my search is getting cut short!
I’ve also heard there’s some research facility near\nthe entrance of the Great Crater of Paldea...\c\nThey say it’s fallen into disuse, but...ooh, I want\nto find it so bad! I just want to see what’s there!
I am a Dragon Tamer... ▶
We Dragon Tamers are wielders of dragon\nPokémon!
It seems you are even better at wielding your\npreferred Pokémon than I am.
Dragons are a challenge to raise, but they have\nfew weaknesses. If you can raise them to be\r\nstrong enough, victory will be yours.
I don’t wanna... ▶
I don’t wanna do my job! No!
Waaaaaahhh! You meaniehead!
I’ve actually been having a really tough time at\nwork lately, but that sure helped!\c\nThere’s nothing like letting yourself act childish\nwhen you’re feeling overwhelmed!
Astounding! ▶
Astounding! You have a Tera Orb, do you?
How dazzling!
Tera Orbs are quite precious, so only the best\nstudents and teachers are allowed to have them.
Wahaha! ▶
Wahaha! I’m out here enjoying my youth on my\nTreasure Hunt!
Wahaha! Nothing will stop my enjoyment!
The only way to win in life is to enjoy it!\nIt’s a waste to think you should or shouldn’t\r\ndo something simply because of your age!
I want to be\nlike the wind... ▶
I want to be like the wind and travel across the\nwhole wide world!
Why are the winds of fate always blowing\nagainst me?!
I saw this floaty Pokémon wafting along on the\nbreeze nearby!
“Beep-beep-beep” goes the\ncabbie, all through the sky ♪ ▶
Gah! Where’d you come from?! I was singing to\nmyself thinking there was no one around!
I couldn’t even win, I was so embarrassed...
I was trying to think up a jingle to use on our\ncommercials for the Flying Taxi...\r\n“All through the sky...” ♪
I just can’t decide! ▶
I just can’t decide! What do you think?\c\nShould I go to Artazon to experience real art?\nOr Levincia for big-city thrills?
I guess I should have been worrying more about\nwhich move to use in battle...
Maybe I’ll go experience the art in Artazon...\nThere are a bunch of different art installations\r\non display all over the town.
It’s just no good... ▶
It’s just no good! I...I can’t control my power!
Phew! Thanks for helping me tamp down my\npower like that! It can be pretty overwhelming!
My power is too great for my own good.\nSometimes it runs amok, and I just defeat every\r\nTrainer I meet. Glad that didn’t happen to you!
What should I throw...? ▶
Pop quiz! What should I throw if I want to start\na battle?
Well, that result sure threw me!
It’s so nice how you can just throw a Poké Ball\ncontaining one of your Pokémon at a wild\r\nPokémon to dive right into a battle!
I’ll stick with it! ▶
I’ll show you! I’m tenacious, and I’ll stick it out\nno matter how hard the battle gets!
Even though you’ve beat me, I still won’t give up!
Attacking isn’t the only way to be strong! There\nare all kinds of moves that help you stick it out!
My Pokémon! ▶
My Pokémon! And your Pokémon! What’s so\ndifferent about them?!
E-everything’s different!
Individual Pokémon have different individual\nstrengths, even if they’re the same species.
All right! ▶
All right! Just one bout! This’ll be a good\nwarm-up before I head to the work site!
That didn’t warm me up at all...
You’re real strong, kid! What do you do to\nwarm up?
Enjoying your day off? ▶
Enjoying your day off? ’Cause I am!
Goodness, you’re strong!
I finally took some time off work, but I just\ncouldn’t leave my cleaning supplies behind...\r\nMaybe I work too much...
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-hooo! ▶
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-hooo! Get ready to see a real\nchef at work!
Now why’d you go and do that?! I just wanted to\nmake some sandwiches for a picnic!
When your Pokémon are feeling rough after\nbattling, feed them sandwiches to perk them up.
Your bill... ▶
If you lose to me, your bill will be 1,000,000!
Wait, I got the math wrong!
I-I was only kidding before! You didn’t really\nexpect me to pay you THAT much, did you?
Squawkabilly! ▶
What powers our Flying Taxis? Squawkabilly’s\nplucky spirit!
What spirit! I love it!
Did you know that wild Squawkabilly of the same\ncolor tend to flock together?
My map keeps spinning! ▶
The map app in my phone keeps spinning!\nMake it stop!
I’m in a real downward spiral now!
So you can set your map so that north is always\nat the top, can you?\c\nAs you get up in years like me, figuring out these\nsmartphones can make you feel awful dumb!
You! ▶
I saw you at the school, talking so familiarly with\nDirector Clavell!
Oh, sweet Clavell, what do you see in this\nne’er-do-well...
Director Clavell has such a gentle and refined\ndemeanor. He’s simply lovely...
To be a waiter... ▶
To be a waiter is to wait. I’ll wait for the perfect\nmoment to take care of you!
N-now wait just a moment!
My battle strategy hinges on sometimes waiting\nfor my opponent to land a blow before I do.\r\nBut sometimes I lose if I wait too long...
Sunflora! ▶
Sunflora flood the floral fiefdom in formation!\nSunflora flood the floral fiefdom in formation!\r\nI made up my own tongue twister!
Sunflora flood the flooof—\nDah! No! I messed up!
Sunflora flood the floral fiefdom in formation! I\nmade my tongue twister ’cause I love Sunflora.\c\nThe Gym Test in Artazon was right up my alley!
My reason for living! ▶
My work is my reason for living! It’s something\nthat’s worth doing, and it gives me purpose!
Well, since I lost, I guess I’ll be getting back to\nwork now!
If you do what you love for work, then at least\nyou know you’ll enjoy that part of your life!\c\nIt won’t be all fun and games, but it’s still better\nthan a kick in the teeth!
The Fire crew... ▶
Did you know Team Star’s Fire crew has a base\nnear here?
You’re on fire!
The boss of the Fire crew is this girl named Mela.\nShe talks real tough and scares me silly!
The Great Crater\nof Paldea... ▶
Have you been to the Great Crater of Paldea?
What! You beat me?! My confidence is cratering!
They say that there’s this mysterious place called\nArea Zero inside the Great Crater of Paldea—\r\nand that great treasures sleep within it!
I wanna be\nnumber one! ▶
I wanna be number one! I’m gonna be\nthe strongest!
I guess maybe we can share being number one!
Outta all the Champions, there’s a number-one\nstrongest one called the Top Champion!\r\nBoy, that’s what I wanna be someday!
Y’know what? ▶
Y’know what? I wanna become real strong.\nJus’ like Missy Nemona is!
G-gotta be like Missy Nemona!
*sniffle* O-oh... *sniffle* Thanks for the battle...\c\nDoes Missy Nemona cry when she loses?\nI...I guess I’ve gotta be...t-tough...
Are you the client...? ▶
Are you the client? Did you manage to bring the,\nah, sample that I contacted you about?
I-I’m pretty sure you aren’t my client! Please!\nDon’t make me battle any more!
Sh-shove off, won’t you! Before anyone sees!\nI’m supposed to meet someone here who said\r\nthey’d show me some super cute Pokémon!
That was one\ntasty-looking Pokémon. ▶
I don’t know how to describe it, but it’s...like...\nman, that Pokémon I saw! It looked delicious!
I don’t know how to put this, but...like...thanks\nfor the battle!
So this really tasty-looking Pokémon, right? It was\njust going along, then this other huge Pokémon\r\nwent and, like, gulped it right down!\c\nI guess that’s what happens when you look so\ndarn tasty. You get eaten, that’s what.
I’ve heard the rumors... ▶
I’ve heard the rumors of a Pokémon in these\nlands—one known as the False Dragon Titan!
But what is this False Dragon?! What is real?!\nWhat is false?!
Could it be that the False Dragon Titan isn’t a\nreal dragon at all? But...but...\c\nWhat’s even the point if it’s not a real dragon?
Take a picture for\nme, would you? ▶
I’m about to beat you. It’d be great if you could\ntake a commemorative photo for me when I do!
I don’t need a photo to commemorate losing!
Um, sorry if I was a bit over the top just then...\c\nAll this wide-open space really gives the ol’\nemotions room to run wild!
Hoooh! Haaah! ▶
Hoooh! Haaah!\nHoooh! Haaah!\r\nYes, the air out here truly is fine! Breathe deep!
Why, I detect a hint of a salt on the breeze!
The air out here is the best of any I’ve had. I’d\nhappily live on it all my remaining days!
Oooh! Ow-ow-ow! ▶
I spent too long crouched down sneaking through\nthe tall grass—now my back is killing me!
I wonder if I could’ve won if my back wasn’t\nacting up like this...
You can get close to wild Pokémon without them\nnoticing you if you crouch down nice and low.\r\nBut your back might regret it...
Wow, all the\nway out here? ▶
You’ve sure put in some effort, coming all the\nway out here on your own little legs.
Those little legs hold up some real great skills!
There aren’t any towns or Pokémon Centers or\nanything around these parts.\c\nIf you get tired, don’t try to tough it out! Give a\nFlying Taxi a call!
What if I put\nthe camera here? ▶
I’m actually a singer, see. I came out here to\nscout a location for my next music video.
I got beat by some...some NOBODY?!
That’s it! We’re definitely not filming here!\c\nI can’t even stand here without remembering that\nI lost a battle to someone like you!
The greatest view of all... ▶
I’m traveling the expanse of Paldea in search of\nthe greatest view of all.
I wonder how the world looks in your eyes?
I thought I might have finally found the greatest\nview of all here, but it seems I was wrong...\r\nI think there are still greater sights to aspire to!
Mushroom! Mushroom! ▶
Mushroom! Mushroom? MushROOOOOOM!
Oh! My word! Please forgive me! I was quite\ncaught up in my own world there for a moment...
I was playing with the adorable little mushroom\nPokémon and lost all track of where I was!
*pant pant* ▶
I was...climbing this rock face...so I’m...outta\nbreath...but my team’s...fine!
Phew... Hah!
If only I could...ride a Pokémon and let it do the\nclimbing...
If I could only\ncross the sea... ▶
Lend me a Pokémon that can take me across\nthe sea!
Looks like I’m sunk!
If only there was some Pokémon I could ride over\nthe sea, I could be sitting and sipping something\r\non a sandy beach right now!
Been out east? ▶
One of Team Star’s bases is off to the east of\nhere. So scary!
I guess if I was as strong as you, I wouldn’t need\nto be scared, even of Team Star!
Team Star’s Fighting crew has a base off to the\neast of here, and their boss is super scary...\r\nTh-that grim look she’s always got—brrr!
Quite the traveler,\naren’t you? ▶
You’ve come a good long way since setting out\nfrom the academy, haven’t you?
Yes, I could feel precisely how much experience\nyou’ve gained on your travels.
You and I have both walked the same distance,\nand yet I still lost to you.\c\nI suppose that the paths you’ve chosen must have\nbeen richer in what they offered.
This...is...ridiculous! ▶
So ridiculous! I was doing the Snow Slope Run on\nGlaseado Mountain and ended up...here!\r\nWhere the heck is “here” anyway?!
Whoa! Your Pokémon are ridiculously strong!
I wasn’t actually planning to come here, but this\nended up pretty fun, too! Huh!
Yes! At last! ▶
Hey! Hey, you there! You’re mine! Once I defeat\nyou, you’ll be another “feather in my cap”!\r\nBut what does that even mean?!
Looks like we may never know!
Sure, if you just looked up the phrase, you could\nfind out in a sec what it means...but it’s fun\r\nmaking people stop and wonder!
Sandwiches... Yes... ▶
Apparently this one earl thought up sandwiches\nbecause he wanted to be able to eat while\r\nkeeping a hand free to play games!
I guess Pokémon battling isn’t really a game...\nSeems I can’t pull it off one-handed!
I love learning the history of things. I always ace\nall my history tests, too.
I am the\ndragon’s wings! ▶
I am the eldest of three sisters, the one who’s\nclaimed the dragon’s wings! I’ll blast you away!
It seems I failed to take flight...
Dragons may be slow to grow, but if you put the\ntime into raising one, they’re fearsomely strong!
I am the\ndragon’s breath! ▶
I am the second of three sisters, the one who’s\nclaimed the dragon’s breath! I’ll blow you away!
You left me no time to catch my breath...
Dragons are weak to Ice-type moves, and they\nhave a hard time taking on cute little fairies, too.
I am the\ndragon’s tail! ▶
I am the youngest of three sisters, the one who’s\nclaimed the dragon’s tail! And I’ll send you flying!
I might have to turn tail and run!
It was my big sister who thought up this whole\nthing about us being different parts of a dragon...\r\nHonestly, I find it all a bit embarrassing.
So free! ▶
I’m no longer bound by the office! The whole\nwide world is my office now!
I think it’s time I clock out for the day!
Hmmm. If the whole world is my office...does that\nmean I never actually leave work?
Bamboo shoots pop-\npop-popping up! ▶
I came out hunting for bamboo shoots, but I\nguess I could forage for battles while I’m at it!
Shoot, I was so busy thinking about bamboo\nthat I didn’t focus on the battle...
Big Bamboo Shoots are quite valuable, so you\ncan sell them at shops for a tidy profit!
Unbelievable! ▶
Gosh, I feel like a buffoon! I thought the thing\nI saw was just a mushroom, but it was ALIVE!
I guess there really are fungus among us!
The Mushroom Pokémon Foongus is poisonous\ntoo, so be careful around it!
These falls... ▶
These falls are said to be quite famous. I’ll help\ncommemorate your visit with a fine battle!
I got so worked up the sweat was pouring down\nmy back like a cascade!
They’re called the Fury Falls...but I wonder what’s\ngot them so angry?
Pro...wrestling? ▶
You young’uns call that flashy sport pro wrestling,\nright? Is it popular among your set these days?
It seems you are a pro at Pokémon battles.
I saw a student up ahead who was all done up in\nthe most outrageous pro wrestling outfit.\c\nIt was absolutely splendid! I wonder if she would\nlet me join her in her shenanigans?
Hyah! Rah! ▶
I got my black belt through an online course!
Wait, this stuff is way harder in real life?!
Nowadays you can do everything online! It’s a\nnew age of remote learning!
I’ll. Show. YOU! ♥  ▶
I’m super strong! I’ll. Show. YOU! ♥
You. Beat. ME! ♥
You’re super strong! You’re. The. BEST! ♥
A backpacker’s\nonly weakness! ▶
A backpacker’s only weakness is Steel-type\nmoves!
Darn, you saw through my lie?
My real weakness is Reality-type moves! I just\nwant to get away from reality! Ahaha...hah...
The academy\nhas a secret! ▶
If you can defeat me, I’ll tell you the academy’s\nbig secret!
I lost? Then I guess I’ve got no choice but to spill\nthe beans...
The academy had some kind of big brouhaha\nback when I first enrolled.\c\nAll the teachers at the time quit. The teachers\nwe’ve got now were all hired after that.
I’m sick of it! ▶
I’m just so sick of research! Help distract me so\nI can forget about my work for a while!
What is your training method? And what do you\nfeed your team? Are their moves from TMs?
Even when I want to stop questioning everything,\nI can’t! I guess this is why I’m a scientist.
I am strong. ▶
I am strong. And so I battle.
You...are strong!
I am strong. You are stronger. That is all there is\nto it, really.
Delivery! ▶
I’m a courier...fan! I just like to dress up like this!
Please sign here!
Couriers have a pretty passionate fan base! It may\nbe a niche interest, but we’re out there!
That’s right... ▶
That’s right...I’m totally lost!
You’re not lost at all, are you?! Don’t tell me...\nYou actually WANTED to come out here?!
I was trying to catch a Pokémon, followed it all\nthe way out here...and ended up getting lost!\r\nI think I’ll call a Flying Taxi!

This is my spot! ▶
This is my spot! If you want to camp, go find a\nspot of your own!
Oh, are you just here for a hike? Not to camp?
Food always tastes better up in the mountains,\ndoesn’t it? I guess exhaustion is the best spice!

Such a shame... ▶
It was such a shame, what happened to Grusha.\nThat accident ruined his snowboarding career!
Ah, sorry for going on about old news! I suppose\nthat all must have been before your time.
Grusha was once the second best snowboarder\nin all the world...\c\nBut he was injured in an accident—badly enough\nthat he was forced to retire from the sport.
I understand! ▶
I understand! Here! In this freezing land!\nI’ve finally come to understand a great truth!
Yes, you’ve made me understand it all too well!
I understand now that training in freezing places\nisn’t efficient! You don’t get strong—just sick!\r\nAh-ah-ah-CHOOO!
That uniform... ▶
That uniform looks really good on you! Do you\nthink it would look good on me too?
I-is that a no?!
Seeing you out having adventures in your uniform\nreminded me of my own school days, that’s all...
I need more data! ▶
I’ve decided my research subject for the day!\nAllow me to collect some data from YOU!
Why can’t I seem to capture your data?!
I couldn’t collect any data at all! Is something\nwrong with my equipment?!
Ow! Ow! Ow! ▶
I twisted my ankle climbing over some rocks.\nMaybe a battle will distract me from the pain!
I forgot about my ankle, but now my pride hurts!
Isn’t it handy how Pokémon can go and heal\nthemselves of minor injuries or status conditions\r\nif they’re holding a Berry?

I’ve got three\nGym Badges! ▶
I’ve got three Gym Badges, but I failed the\ninterview at the Pokémon League!
I got three Gym Badges and still got beat by\nsome little kid?!
I guess the Pokémon League won’t give you a\nserious interview unless you have eight badges...?
[~ 1458]
[~ 1459]
[~ 1460]
[~ 1461]
Such beauty... ▶
Such beauty, only to be marred by ugly piles of\njunk! I can’t stand it!
Sorry, sorry! Guess I shouldn’t have taken out my\nfrustration on you!
Is that one of those Team Star bases? I guess\nthey must have put a lot of effort into building it.
Team Star! ▶
I came here to join Team Star!
If I can’t even defeat a regular old student, will\nI even make the cut for Team Star...?
I don’t yet have the strength for Team Star! Guess\nI’ll have to train up and try again... Whoof...
The power of music! ▶
The power of music can bring joy to the world!
Bow to the power of musiiiiiic!
Maybe I should worry less about the power of\nmy music and more about the power of my team.
I need a new job... ▶
Maybe working at the Pokémon Center near here\nwould be more fun than my current job...
Gaaah! I’ve got to go heal my Pokémon!
Kids like you must keep the workers at the\nPokémon Center busy all the time!
(This is so boring...) ▶
My boyfriend and I came here for a picnic, but I\nguess I’ve got some free time to battle you!
Oooh, how exciting!
Honestly, who goes on a picnic for a date?\nAren’t picnics for kids?
(I hope this\ngoes well...) ▶
I came here for a picnic with my girlfriend! I’m so\nnervous! Help me calm my nerves!
No, I’m still so nervous! This was such a big step!\nIs a picnic too much, too fast?
I can’t wait to hang out with my girlfriend, just\nmaking sandwiches and relaxing together!
Isn’t that the\nschool where— ▶
Is there a woman named Miriam working at your\nschool? She and I once worked together.
It seems you’re getting a good education!
Miriam and I used to work together at a\nPokémon Center once upon a time.\c\nOf course, we’ve each gone down our own paths,\nbut I’m glad to hear she’s still doing her best.
Sea Pokémon! ▶
I swam out here to catch Pokémon from the sea!
Oh no, swimming cramp!
I’d swim to the very end of the seas if it meant\nfinding rare Pokémon!
I can’t find it... ▶
I’ve looked everywhere, but I just can’t find it!\c\nI can’t find my potential anywhere!
Seems my potential doesn’t lie in battle, either...
Children are just bursting with potential...\nMeanwhile, I feel like my bubble’s burst.

[~ 213]

Its paws are soaked in oodles of honey. When\nnervous, Teddiursa will lick its paws and soon\nhave a smile back on its face.
